Action,godzilla_minus_one,"Among the pantheon of Godzilla films, Minus One is one of the finest entries in the franchise’s 70-year history. It balances spectacle with substance, offering longtime fans and newcomers a reason to believe in the enduring power of the King of Monsters. The presentation of the family drama and life in Japan after WW2 are as good as the depiction of the monster. However, the melodrama went a bit overboard and the usual lagging we see in Japanese films are still here. Good, but not as good as Shin Godzilla In Japan, the monster gives food for thought: it offers pretexts to illuminate dark passages of history, to explore the complexities that exist in some human beings, to denounce and expose guilt. [Full review in Spanish] ""In the US, we see a lot of advanced technology, mumbo-jumbo, and things that aren't exactly grounded in reality to help defeat an undefeatable monster, but that's why this period piece is so cool. We're really just using what we have. Godzilla Minus One proves once again that big tent-pole filmmaking is not Hollywood’s playground. Spectacular effects work stands alongside a beautiful story of human resilience in the wake of war. A strong cast of characters keeps us grounded amid the scenes of impressive yet restrained kaiju destruction. Almost all the men are veterans who’ve seen the horrors behind the old lie, Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori (“It’s sweet and fitting to die for one’s country”). . . . “Not having been to war is something to be proud of[.]” I love this movie and call it a hidden-gem of a film.   If you like film, you should watch it. If you do not enjoy it, I’m not sure there is much anybody can do for you. Good movie, highly enjoyable. [Full review in Spanish] It propels the franchise to new heights and reaffirms Godzilla as the undisputed king of the monsters. [Full review in Spanish] Godzilla Minus One is worth watching. [Full review in Spanish] Perhaps Godzilla Minus One has too many melodramatic moments. But Godzilla emerges from the depths of the sea and creates wonderment. [Full review in Spanish] This love letter to ordinary Japanese citizens who pull together to get the country out of hard times succeeds in delivering genuine emotion along with monster action. Despite the film’s charming background and ostensible small size, Minus One is tapping into the same thrills of blockbuster filmmaking with the support of hard-earned pathos. This is a legitimately great adventure film — not just a great Godzilla film — with moments of overwhelming despair and joy... The best Godzilla movie I've seen so far! Kudos to Yamazaki & team for crafting a compelling human story that elicits genuine empathy, while delivering a gargantuan Oscar-worthy spectacle. ..far more involving and emotional than it might be expected to be. With striking special effects, a fearsome monster, much ingenuity and a strong political viewpoint, this really is quite a reboot, and certainly puts the goofy Hollywood version to shame… It has the moments of destruction and violence that one should expect from such a film. But it also contains a story that says a lot about PTSD, the use of soldiers in war, the future we leave to the young, and the value of life. Full review in Spanish. Yamazaki’s screenplay has subtly framed Shikishima as a stand-in for the nation at large, sloughing off macho Imperial dogma from underneath a suffocating shroud of survivor’s guilt. ","This is the best iteration I’ve seen regarding Godzilla. Godzilla looked terrifying and really commanded every scene he was in. The story surrounding him was very well thought out and the characters had great development and depth. They could have made a completely different story (not about Godzilla) and it still would have been good in my opinion. Also I thought subtitles might ruin the experience but it actually made it better and added to the authenticity. I highly suggest watching it on the big screen. It is insane to think this movie was made by a small team with such a high quality, this movie did not came to my Theaters but if it were i would definitely came to a 3rd time As a big Godzilla fan, this movie was an awe-inspiring masterpiece, it was so good. The action was incredible in the film and the story was so emotional and great to follow along with. In my opinion, this is the best Godzilla film, period This movie was released on Godzillas birthday anniversary and man this vfx was the true game of it Went in with way too high of expectations. It's a fine film, but the hype is way overstated. Teetering between 3 and 3.5 but sticking with 3 because overall let down given the way its been acclaimed. The BEST Godzilla!!! This film might just be the most faithful interpretation of the Daikaijū since 1998's Matthew Broderick entry. But it goes far beyond mere homage. This Godzilla is a love letter to fans, delivered with a brutal honesty that's refreshing in today's filmmaking landscape.

True to his status as a product of nuclear weaponry this version of Godzilla is a walking nuclear nightmare, leaving a path of utter devastation in its wake with intentional mass destruction, contaminating entire landscapes with radiation poisoning just by walking through along with the tragic loss of countless lives, both human and marine, to unleashing atomic breath just like when a nuclear bomb is detonated.

The film seamlessly blends personal struggles with the classic monster movie spectacle, creating a powerful and cohesive experience.

Set in a post-war Japan still grappling with the aftermath of conflict, the film benefits from remarkably honest portrayals by its cast. We follow a traditional, yet unconventional, Japanese family struggling with the emotional fallout of war. Denial, regret, and a simmering thirst for vengeance simmer beneath the surface, emotions relatable to any audience and masterfully amplified by the monstrous threat.

Sum up -Breathtaking, devastating, but above all else, honest. Silliness with an undertone of serious messsging. Not a movie that resllg lives within any of its own rules or logic. If Studio Ghibili's slice of life vibe could have a baby with a monster movie this would be its surprisingly beautiful offspring. 

The story hooked me from beginning to end, unlike other Godzilla movies where the scenes between the monster mayhem feel more like filler time to save on the CGI effects budget, I found myself genuinely invested in the characters. 

I found myself rooting for our protagonist and his unlikely family, the character growth, the dialogue, and the ease in which the director balanced Kaiju destruction and story telling which is rare in the genre of modern monster movies.

Its art and sound design gave it a modern classic feel. Combining styles and elements from the first time Godzilla appeared on screen but with modern polish. 

If I could critic this film I would have to mention that the acting was over the top at times. It had that feeling that live-action anime adaptations have when they try to translate the character mannerisms from animation to live-action. Though with the style and direction this film takes it makes sense as an artistic choice to have it be over the top, adding to the modern classic feel Godzilla Minus One focuses so strongly on. 

This outcome came mainly from the pacing. Godzilla Minus One took its time to establish its characters, their stories, and their conflicts and plot which made the ending so much more satisfying than any American version of the Godzilla franchise and most film now a days. Films tend to rush through their stories especially with any kind of action/superhero/monster movie. They tend to have flimsy plots with lose connections and ""yeah yeah yeah we'll get to that later"" mentalities. Which is why Godzilla Minus One hits the spot so well. My only wish is that I could have seen this in theaters. This film is a monsterpiece. And possibly my second favorite film of 2023. The best Godzilla movie I've seen in theaters! I saw Godzilla 2000 when that released, but that was nothing like this one. This was amazing and can't wait to own this when it's released.... Godzilla Minus One is the start of a new generation of movie making. The Visual Effects and Animation team did a great job giving life to Godzilla. The story and emotion is also the key on this movie. wow! so good. not what we expected at all. highly recommend. I love this movie and uh Takashi Yamazaki and the cast and crew did a good job while on a 15 million dollar budget and umm i can't recommend a movie enough since it's a really really good movie. The mix of drama, action, horror and a little tiny itty bitty sprinkle of romance that is mixed in this movie is why it's my most favorite movie of all time... also i love Godzilla so yeah. - Dogzilla best movie ever made, hands down. As a long time admirer of Godzilla movies and having watched most of the new franchise and the keystone films from the older Japanese era (although it was a lifetime ago).  I eagerly awaited the opportunity to see the latest instalment, and I must say that my expectations met and at times, more than exceeded.

Instantly you feel that the film's production values are reminiscent of the past, originals, and the cinematography is picture perfect, with every scene crafted to be as realistic as possible despite the period setting. Each backdrop created with historic accuracy of old Japanese building and infrastructure in the city, and the bombed cities with dilapidated shacks post attacks.  

The blending of emotions, action, and thrill is done extremely well concocting the ideal entertainment cocktail. The 2-hour run time seemed to fly by.

Godzilla is suitably elemental and monstrous, and each of the human characters are thoughtfully portrayed and sympathetic, no easy feat since the film is set in a WWII Japanese era. The only thing that makes me chuckle throughout the film are the ridiculous arms of Godzilla, bringing back flashbacks of the t-rex books I have read to to my toddler.  Possibly amongst the radioactivity Godzilla has been hitting the gym pretty hard. 

What i thought was different and unique about this version is that it added depth to the human element, complete with fractured cities and families. Into this mess wades a monster from the sea that starts stomping streets, crashing into buildings, and tossing railroad cars (with strange arms)  etc. all done without the over use of CGI, often making the film feel almost from an older era.It blends practical effects seamlessly with the limited CGI the film does have, creating a truly believable world under siege. From the colossal Godzilla to the human devastation, every detail is meticulously crafted.

The character development for me is the key winning factor here. The screenwriter sets up a prologue of events that lets the audience connect with the characters, helping us understand their motivations and actions. 
 The camerawork is on point as well often putting you right in the shoes of characters grappling with paralysing fear and running in order to survive. 

Powerful performances make you feel every emotion alongside the characters. Ryunosuke Kamiki takes center stage, portraying a complex hero wrestling with trauma, as he feels an urge for revenge, alongside a sense of hopelessness. His connection with other characters adds layer of humanity, making their struggles just captivating.

This film is more than just a Kaiju movie; it explores themes of patriotism, endurance, short arm syndrome and the will to move forward. But aside from all that it's a pretty darn awesome, oversized lizard creating havoc film. 9/10 I love it this movie Best Godzilla Movie of all time! The human characters are for once interesting to watch, Godzilla looks awesome and is made really well a mixture of the Heisei version and the 1954 and Legendary Godzilla. 
Best Movie I have seen of 2023... If you’re only going to watch one Godzilla movie in your life, I might recommend that it be Godzilla Minus One. I’ve seen a handful of them and, to be honest, I haven’t been very impressed. However, this version has a compelling plot surrounding the humans. The actors aren’t acting like they’re in a cheesy monster flick, they’re giving highly dramatic performances. It also helped me realize why people are afraid of Godzilla. He’s menacing and terrifying and when he attacks, it all seems so hopeless. They could have subtracted about 20 minutes or so from Godzilla Minus One, but I enjoyed watching it. Why Minus One?"
Action,napoleon_2023,"A paint-by-numbers biopic that seems woefully indecisive in its opinion of the man whose story it’s portraying. I’m invigorated and inspired by the fact that a movie like Napoleon can exist in the modern era ... the blend of war epic and farcical romance, acted and directed masterfully, is the kind of full spectacle that we go to the movies for. I mean, the movie was perplexing at points, but this reads like someone having an out-of-body experience... Each act contains a spectacle-filled battle scene, beautifully choreographed, lit, and shot. Scott (“Gladiator”) knows what he’s doing with action scenes. No complaints here. The rest of the narrative trips him up, however.  Napoleon is a challenging epic. Napoleon is the confluence of two centuries of documentation and innuendo, and how, maybe, a tyrant who led millions to their death doesn’t deserve better than to be portrayed as a weird little guy horny for his mean wife. Scott’s depiction of Napoleonic warfare is equal parts beautiful and brutal. “Napoleon” is a gorgeous movie, but you won’t see it when you fall asleep between battles. The combination of pitch perfect visuals with comedic, outlandish dialogue does not ever gel, and Scott lacks the necessary pacing to let everyone enjoy the joke.  A battle-laden pilgrimage through the historical highlights of France's most prolific Emperor cuts considerable corners in conveying his military machinations. Questionable casting, jarring tonal shifts and a repetitive dependence on the battlefield... On its way to theatrical release, 'Napoleon' has lost an hour and a half of footage, affecting a dramatic progression that feels too disjointed, cold, and at times, lacking in soul.  This lavish production never feels like an incredible story, nor does it ever feel particularly intimate. Truthfully, Napoleon rarely feels like anything; perfunctory emotions that are adequately portrayed by talented actors adrift in a sea of tedium. This two and a half hour-plus battle-heavy film shies away from nothing and really does give you kind of what you expect- epic action in a way that we know and love Ridley Scott for and a bonkers performance that we know and love Joaquin Phoenix for. Although I was never bored, this two-and-a-half-hour film made me feel like I was sitting through a three-and-a-half-hour film.
 Napoleon is a shallow collection of impressions, “psychological” insight of the dime-store variety and brief battle scenes, which are not even presented so as to explain Napoleon’s military prowess. Who was it that said history was just one damn thing after another? This is what Sir Ridley Scott's epic [...] feels like when not focused on the electrifying performance of Joaquin Phoenix.  Ridley Scott's ""Napoleon"" is more of a romantic epic than an exploration of the personality of a despot. [Full Review in Spanish] Tonally, it’s flat and unengaging, leaving us uncertain whether we should be taking it seriously or reading Phoenix’s simpering interpretation of Napoleon as satire. Scott makes no apologies for Napoleon and never treats him as some hero for France. Napoleon succeeds at presenting the insecurities of this man’s life for audiences who may be unaware of French history. I just wish it was narrower in its scope. Joaquin Phoenix’s blustering performance conquers as Napoleon. This is such a misfire. It is 2 hours and 38 minutes of my life I would like back. At the end of the movie, I knew nothing more about Napoleon than I did when it started.","Didn't do Bonaparte any justice, the thick American accents take me right out of the moment. Although, there are many historical inaccuracies that part is relatively easy to get over. The movie feels like a bunch of trailers strung together, into a jumbled mess and embarrassment to Napoleon's story. There is nearly zero indication in the movie that Napoleon is a great or even decent general. All in all a mumbled together movie which likely needed its own show, but Ridley Scott would mess that up so. I enjoy these types of movies but this one wasn’t my favorite. I felt like it had some good parts, especially the action scenes. They did a great job building the scene and tensions. The problem was that it felt a little too long and they probably could have cut some scenes short to speed up the pacing. The scenes between the battles dragged on a little bit and I got bored from it. yawn, yawn and yawn. it was too long and read about it in a history book. you'll find it more interesting. Watch anything on history march instead http://youtu.be/55dNKFvKuQs?si=gaUQoJRE5Er1q8XR Snooze Fest! Not the best performance from Phoenix. Editing seems to be a lost art in Hollywood these days. The sex scenes were perverted and gratuitous. It would be easy enough to suggest what is happening in a classy way with some well timed edits, instead these cringe sex scenes just made a mockery of the relationship of Napoleon and his empress. Slept throughout half of it. Terrible acting, lots of violence and little to learn or appreciate about the film. First of all, like most movies he stars in, Joachim Phoenix owns this movie.

The battle scenes are immense as you would expect, and despite what many of the 'real' critics say, there are plenty of these action sequences to keep you engaged in between the non-action scenes.

If you can forgive the lack of French accents from, you know, the guys playing the French parts, and you like a good historic war drama, you should enjoy this film. A pretty decent film. If you’re going to deviate that much from undisputed historical sources, just create a fictional character. The script was horrible. In my opinion, Director mistake is a lack of dcreen time - the story of Napoleon deserve more films - at least 4, like his company in russia, described in War And Peace, was filmed as 4 movies, waterloo was the long seperate movie, but he tried hid best - Phoenix is perfectly suitable for this role looks like a movie made by a person who don’t know nothing about history One of the biggest cinematic disappointments in recent memory. Terribly written, and even more poorly acted. Perhaps the worst performance of Joaquin Phoenix’s career. Difícil de ver, errores históticos, casi parece un fan fiction de Bonaparte. My god., I couldn't stay more than 30min. So boring. So stupid. I'm French so I loves to see all English speakers too 😂😂
Thanks ridley Scott to let me waste 30min of my life 🍅 6.3/10


Joaquin Phoenix Really do be making them clap sounds 🤨 I mean since he’s short a couple inches had to go somewhere right. It’s nothing bad just nothing remarkable it feels like it should be more epic but ends up being a stale drama that focuses on its most uninteresting plot. Still there’s some pretty cool fights and great set pieces and the performances are pretty good all around. Grade B This movie was truly made only for the big screen. I enjoyed it immensely.  Joaquin pheonix is sublime as napoleon and Ridley Scott delivers his battle sequences in perfect formation. Enjoyable flick but I feel Joaquin Phoenix was miscast on this one. He seemed too sluggish and docile to be
the aggressive French Emperor that carved out a name for himself forever in the history books.
The final battle scene at Waterloo was fantastic though and worth watching just for that. Bad movie. Bonaparte was not a kid or a puppet. How can the director write : 6 millions people died because of Napoléon? 6 millions soldiers died because of kings and kingdoms around France were afraid about loosing their power.
It's juste an example : this movie is a story not History.
No need to watch this stupid movie."
Action,the_hunger_games_the_ballad_of_songbirds_and_snakes," It may not always sing like a songbird when taken as a whole, but The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes still packs a venomous bite at its best. ...retains the hard edge that made most of these movies register as piercing satires of our reality-television age. Ballad sanitizes its brutality for a PG-13 rating and diminishes the story’s sense of high-stakes survive-or-die suspense, and Francis Lawrence’s approach to action sequences is bland and uninspired, a reflection of the film’s generic visual aesthetic.  A surprisingly bleak yet narratively elemental mishmash of derivative dystopian tropes, the film's real subversion exists in the delightfully garish and incredibly callous supporting characters bedazzling the decadent capital of Panem.  While many critics have carped about the decision to hand an entire film over to a character everyone knows will turn evil (apparently, these critics never heard of the Star Wars prequels), the truth is that it’s surprisingly compelling. Aside from an interesting and somewhat original story,  The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes has a wonderful cast that includes younger thespians mixed with seasoned veterans. Gives a backstory that fleshes out the franchise a little more – and quite honestly, ups the ante. It’s beautifully shot, well-acted, really engaging, and makes for an excellent reason to go to the movies.  There’s still space in this world for the lessons The Hunger Games can teach us about the way we consume media and news, but The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not clear enough in its vision to be as impactful as its predecessors. An involving prequel that understands the troubling politics buckling a society of inequality and gets brutal when necessary in its depiction of the games. Despite a bit muddled third act its an engrossing prologue. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes will cater to tributes, but the unnecessarily long prequel can’t flesh out a one-dimensional villain with a rise and fall narrative in which to emotionally invest. Much better than expected and featuring two stand out performances and a world that I find very interesting overall.  A prequel to the four-film series that provides the origin story for the evil ruler of Panen. The ”snakes” of the title may refer to that mass of multicoloured serpents Dr. Gaul wants to unleash on the hapless tributes, but it’s just as easy to see Coryo as the snake to Lucy Grey’s songbird. [It] has a decent number of exciting, breathtaking moments, as the Games play themselves out. But they can’t sustain that intensity for the full movie, which finds itself borrowing from the past. This film questions what you will do in times of stress: Will you kill when it is the only way to survive, be loyal when it is time to be loyal, fight for love when it might mean death? It is interesting, exciting and looks so good on the big screen Set sixty-four years before the triumph of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the clever screenplay reflects the violence assimilated by the culture. [Full Review in Spanish] The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is more focused on delivering Easter eggs with the subtlety of a sledgehammer than developing these characters. It leaves us with nearly three hours of brand revival. The fun performances by a game cast can't make up for poor pacing and a bloated runtime that feels wholly unearned. It’s still just a slightly modernized, teen-oriented take on ""Rollerball"" or “The Running Man.” THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS AND SNAKES is an incredible extension of the series, both in terms of structure and theme.","I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually wish they had split this up into two movies. I was left really confused after the 3rd part. I cannot wrap my head around any of Snow's motivations for the final 30 minutes or so. The acting (and singing!) and cinematography were fantastic, but the storytelling struggled, which is a shame for this franchise. This is the only series where I tend to strongly prefer the movies to the books. Really bad acting , boring storyline As my first hunger games movie, it is a really addicting for a thrilling battle royale experience as it is how these movies are known for. Interesting characters, interesting story and so much more to begin with. Started to get curious of this book adapted movie trilogy ever since As a prequel to the hunger games, I believe this movie served its purpose. Not overly flashy in cinematics, I believe this movie is decent enough. The actors did a good job, and the storyline followed a straightforward pattern to set up the how the hunger games came to exist. Compared to the hunger games it isn't as well-done but the movie shouldn't be judged so harshly. Didn't expect much but was pleasantly surprised, good story , good acting even good songs ""The Hunger Games presents itself as an engaging and exhilarating cinematic production that captures the attention of viewers through its captivating narrative and exceptional performances. Its grandeur is best appreciated in a theatricalg audiences into a rich and immersive fictional setting, drawinrealm. Embrace the opportunity to partake in this remarkable motion picture in theaters; it is genuinely a mandatory viewing experience, leaving an indelible impression."" I liked the other hunger game movies but this one left me ambivalent. 

Usually there is a hero but there is not one character I could care about. The book was written from Snow's perspective and casts him in a much less sympathetic light. The movie was good though, but I'm glad I read the book first. Admittedly I went in blind, having not read the book and I was pleasantly surprised! Being a big fan of the original books and movies, I had been curious about this one for a while, but hadn't got round to seeing it in cinema as I was on the fence about watching it due to the mixed reception it has received...Ended up finding it free on Neon and found I quite enjoyed it! It isn't perfect by any means as there were plenty of interesting plot points that felt slightly rushed in parts regardless of the films looong run time of 2.5ish hours, so it may have worked better as two movies, combining parts 1 and 2 and fleshing them out more in one film and part 3 also more fleshed out in another, but overall was perfectly serviceable and an effective deep dive into what made Corionalus Snow go rogue and what influenced the later games style. I'm looking forward to the next entry if it's anything like this one! A true blast from the past! Bad acting by Rachel Zegler. Not a good movie. Bad acting distracted me from following the plot. Anoying. The intelligence of the movie is sensational, the scenes of deaths are impacting, the vfx is extraordinary I'd like to rate it higher, as the first 2 acts were very much on point; Entertaining, well written, well paced, visually impressive. There's some stand out moments and although Zegler & Blyth don't set the world on fire with their on screen chemistry, there's still enough of it there to buy in and get invested in the character, enough at least to care about their fates.

Alas, much like the last part of the Original Hunger Games trilogy, they failed to stick the landing. The third act goes om too long and is slow paced so it feels like it goes on even longer. The third act throws the leads somewhat weak chemistry on the clay pigeon launcher and shouts pull. The third act seems to want to be a far more intellectual film that sits terribly with the YA content that it's based on, which balances the film terribly.

I still enjoyed it, but the third act dragged the whole film down overall. Though it is an impressively well-executed standalone prequel to The Hunger Games, the true star of the film is the music. Appalachian bluegrass is presented to an unexpectedly receptive new audience with finesse, in a way that doesn’t feel forced or separate from the plot (which admittedly starts to lag in the third act, although not unbearably). el protagonista es Snow y su historia de cómo se convierte en villano estuvo muy buen contada, ahora la saga de los ""Los Juegos del Hambre"" tiene un nuevo significado. Todavía me acuerdo mi experiencia viendo por primera vez esta saga (bastante tarde y recién durante la pandemia vale aclarar), como me habían encantado las 2 primeras y como sentí la desilusión durante ambas Sinsajo. Y es tal vez esto ultimo lo que me bajo un toque las expectativas sobre esta precuela. Sin embargo (y menos mal) esta nueva entrega me gusto demasiado, convirtiéndose en una de mis favoritas de la saga junto a la segunda. Poco mas que decir, las 2 horas y media me quedaron cortas porque la disfrute en cada momento. Si mi ultimo recuerdo de estos films va a ser esta historia estoy bien con eso. Was such a great movie very modernly shot such incredible writing from how all the hunger games have been shot in relation to the books it’s done very well and the casting is just something else a perfect movie action , sci fi, mystery ending , singing it has something for everyone I don't know what was the budget of this masterpiece, but clearly they didn't have enough money to rent more than one lens as the whole movie looks like it was shot with only wide angle lens. Odd choice. The acting is spectacular, the story-line of Coriolanus turning into Snow and the perfectly showed role of power and control that plays into our real lives now too. I Love it because i am a big hunger games fan, but also because its a great movie. Couldve been just a tiny bit longer tough. Overall it works good acting adds to this. For as long of a run time as the movie has it does not waste time and moves along it is well paced movie. The story is not as strong as the original trilogy but prequels rarely are. The story is satisfying as a whole. I read the book a year before seeing the movie and in this case the movie is better than the book."
Action,animal_2023_2,"Intellectually bankrupt, morally reprehensible and stylistically inept, Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Animal is about as irredeemable as they come. The movies best and worst qualities come from how bold and excessive everything is. The movie is totally unrestrained.  That makes the sequences and characters memorable, but it also makes the runtime totally unnecessary. Trashy, idiotic, and filled with disgusting bloody violence that's overly repetitive, Animal is excruciatingly too long at about 200 minutes. This garbage movie has no redeeming qualities. It's yet another stupid story about feuding and vengeful families. Beyond the never ending reign of bullets and butcherings, both Animal and Kapoor's vicious Ranvijay remain hollow. Animal is a complicated film with a top-tier Ranbir Kapoor, who delivers a powerhouse performance that is worth the price of admission alone. What the film lacks in substance, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga makes up for with sheer audacity and bloodshed. Ranbir Kapoor is deeply committed to his brash and ugly protagonist, but in spite of the movie’s explosive action, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga seems more preoccupied with provoking outrage than with telling a coherent story. Boring, blood-spattered film... Animal’s terrible attitude to women runs alongside a cunning use of India’s religious minorities.  Bigger, longer, bloodier: Animal is all that and more. A story which is cheerfully misogynistic, morally bankrupt and stomach-churningly violent.  All of which I could have endured if the drama and emotions had held.  It is easy to dismiss Animal as an indulgent film, one that achieves none of what it sets out to. It is. It is repulsive, revolting, and one-and-a-half- hours too long. But it is also a film that unravels as retaliation. The film washes past you, like sandpaper being rubbed against your aesthetic and moral convictions.  Watch Animal to see Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor rising above the ridiculous to give a sublime performance. Ranbir Kapoor stars in a blood-soaked drama about daddy issues that is screaming at the top of its lungs with nothing to say. Ranbir Kapoor plays one of the vilest protagonists in cinema history. ANIMAL is a pretty crazy, but somehow totally original and fresh THE GODFATHER remix, with an insane Ranbir Kapoor, a super strong Rashmika Mandanna, great music and, above all, the right amount of humor and irony. The main objective is to serve up everything and the kitchen sink. It can’t be called a cinematic feast, as it is a chore for moviegoers forced to digest heaps of plot points and tangents.  At three hours 21 minutes, Animal is relentless as a euphoric medley of feral rage and dance of the dysfunctional. The twists go on well until end credits as more blood is splattered our way. Welcome to the jungle. Like nearly every factor here, the songs and blood-soaked interludes alike are not without skill, but get kick-dropped into an inorganic whole uninterested in integrating them to sustained, logical or emotionally credible effect. During the interval, I was at a loss of theories. I didn’t know what to make of him or the film. All I could ask was: What’s the point? Why is Animal? Animal is an adrenaline experience which will have polarising views but you can't deny its entertaining quotient, breathtaking performances and storytelling.","WORST MOVIE EVER MADE FOR MANKIND! I appreciate you bobby deol This critic and audience rating difference can be explained by critic females (most movie critics are females) offended by some scenes from the movie. 

This epic motion picture with phenomenal cast, production and direction deserves a one time watch.
Drama and story are not the best. Quite long but wasn't as bad as expected. I didn't find the content so problematic for the first half. Not sure if that was done by the filmmakers for marketing. Had my mind blown by the film 'Animal'! Ranbir Kapoor is on another level, redefining the game with his acting prowess. He brings a perfect blend of swag, emotions, good looks and upholds the Kapoor legacy.
Sandeep Reddy Vanga, the Kabir Singh magician, does it again! Animal is a wild ride of unpredictability, killer action, outstanding screenplay and songs that will stay on loop. The storyline is wild, the action is killer, and those Punjabi beats and dialogues make it a total paisa vasool experience! 💯

Sure, there's been chatter about the film's themes, but isn't cinema supposed to spark discussions? Remember 'Kabir Singh'? The debates around it contributed to its massive success.😂 'Animal' is following suit, gearing up to cross the 800-900 crore mark. 

Art is subjective, and every piece has room for improvement. Each one has their own opinion. While the film might lack a conventional storyline and robust female characters, let's also celebrate the positives. As a cinephile, those 3 hours and 21 minutes were pure entertainment. Sometimes, that's all you need. Just leave your mind at home for this one and you will enjoy! 😄

And can we talk about the Deol brothers making a comeback? Sunny Deol's all-time blockbuster 'Gadar 2' and Bobby Deol doing his mad barbaric thing in 'Animal'- nostalgia hit me like a truck this year. They made our millennial days better with their unforgettable performances in great films! ‘Lord Bobby’ deserves all the appreciation he has been receiving! In fact it has been a great year for the entire Deol family, as veteran actor Dharamendra also gave a good performance in RRKPK!

Here's to cinema that makes us think, feel, and appreciate the craft!

PS: Remember, if film characters really inspired people in reality, most of us would be criminals, roaming around with guns, smoking, drinking all day, practicing domestic violence, etc. etc. Thankfully, it's just the magic of the movies. Stopped watching after the gun fight. It was too much and unrealistic. How in the world this type of a trashy movie was approved? All the female characters were objectified. Specifically saying Rashmika, who has so much potential, was interpreted as more like a mentally disabled vulgar subservient object. Who in the world would just elope with a guy who just says he's the Alpha and commented about your PELVIS. Made no SENSE to me. Too much unnecessary intimacy and useless dialogues. That scene where Ranbir complains about his underwear, I still wonder how that part  connected to the storyline. I don't know what happened afterwards because I could not tolerate this garbage. The director is a psychopath for sure who adores misogynism. I still cannot get my head over the fact that how these reputed actors and actresses agreed to even commit themselves for this trashy plot. A huge amount was put into their pockets, maybe that's why! No character development, no redemption, desensitization to its finest. Parents keep your children away from this garbage. Don't waste your time. And kindly let us rate with negatives; -1 will be the best rating if I could have given. Best Indian Movie Ever in 2023-2024! 10/10 Worst ever disgusting irritating Really if You unbiased Worst movie I have seen for a very long time. Gave up after 2 and an half hours of utter ridiculousness!!!!

Save yourselves wasting 3.5hrs of your life!!! Worst movie ever. No dialogues, no story, too much irrational scenes. Violations. Giving wrong motivations to society. What.the.hell.was.that?! 

I'm fine with gore but good grief! The dialogues, for one thing. Who the hell talks like that?! There were SO many unnecessary scenes, drawn out to eternity for no reason at all. I went in thinking perhaps it's highly stylized. No. It was just bad. 

In short, a terrible storyline to justify gore. Good and the best theater experiance I have watched thousands of movies in my life and this one would be very hard to beat when it comes to being an absolutely horrible, non-sensical and meaningless movie! Ranbir's ""acting"" is trashy and vaudevillian at best. Other characters are there just to fill up the screen and spray bullets at other characters who are also there to fill up the screen. Overall, a complete waste of 2.5 hours of my life. Possibly the most pointless movie with no entertainment element. Truth is that there's no place in this planet where you can relate this movie, it's Unreal. This movie is like video game. In reality there's a law and we all have to obey it.

Acting wise Ranbir is good, Rashmika below average, tripti - good, Bobby - good. Performance and body language of 'saurabh sachdeva' is really impressive. Direction of Reddy sir is fine but again this planet doesn't deserve this kind of cinema. Father- son relationship doesn't go like that, you can't kill hundreds of people to prove that bonding, In reality if you does you will be charged with different sections and will be prosecuted.

4 stars for music. Thanks. A very good bollywood film in a long time! Utterly ridiculous and disturbing story. Non sense and nonstop violence with no moral at the end . Extremely disappointed. Movie of the decade.

Everything is great about this movie.
Already watched it two times.
Will watch it again. Great fun time at the movies & I can't wait got the sequel Honestly hated how he cheated on his wife like it was nothing but if she did the same thing he would kill the guy ... Made me so angry"
Action,silent_night_2023,"Silent Night is old-school John Woo with a new-school twist. It uses the lack of dialogue to its advantage, weaving a narrative free of exposition and fully reliant on the skills of Kinnaman and Woo to carry the story forward.  The film tries to push its “no dialogue” gimmick as a selling point, but in reality, it only hurts the film by making it an awkward experience for both the actors on the screen and the audience watching it. A cacophony of bad. Silent Night works very well in terms of action. [Full review in Spanish] All is not calm, all is not bright in John Woo's propulsive return to Hollywood with this violent, emotionally tacit slice of vigilante vitriol.  Silent Night can’t touch Woo’s all-timers, but it’s still an entertaining, action heavy ride with some surprising heart. There are a couple of Woo's trademark visual flourishes, but by the final act, you'll be yearning for a good old-fashioned expletive to enliven the drab proceedings. John Woo’s first American film in 20 years is not the filmmaker at his peak — but it has its moments, with energetically filmed action enough to distract from a melodramatic tone and sometimes silly concept. For my money, Woo has never been traditionally scripted. Silent Night is not an outlier for Woo, in other words--it's a meticulously-engineered vehicle for action. Silent Night won’t leave you speechless this holiday season. 
 Woo could create action-filled cinema with some emotional resonance, but Silent Night can’t keep up. The final battle and stairway shootout save the film, but don’t expect the wall-to-wall action seen in John Wick. 

 The film is scuppered by its own gimmick. The gimmick of having no dialogue in a movie quickly becomes boring in the idiotic action flick Silent Night, which has too many repetitive scenes of the vigilante protagonist preparing for his revenge mission. Woo’s ability to choreograph mayhem in beautifully bloody fashion, meanwhile, can still be a thrill. In an era that everything has to be socially relevant and politically-correct, “Silent Night” offers an audiovisual extravaganza filled with the most entertaining fanservice, in a blast from the past that actually feels reinvigorating.

 ...all-too-quickly collapses under the weight of its intriguing yet progressively untenable gimmick... This comeback movie has a lot of what Woo is famous for, such as operatic gunfights, but it also has something new: there is almost no dialogue over the 104-minute run-time. Those wanting a John Woo return will have to wait. Unfortunately, Silent Night is too bland, boring, and poorly made to bring him back to the mainstream. Strikes the perfect balance between intense action sequences and equally commanding emotional moments to create a stunning film that fires on all cylinders. This film reunites us with an old teacher who has become a competent imitator of his students. [Full review in Spanish]","Direção excelente, mas roteiro fraquissimo The no dialog gimmick is just that…a conceit that quickly falls flat. I mean, really, the wife has to be mute as well? You can have the actors grimace all you want, but it doesn’t make for a watchable film. This movie is a direct copy of the Kevin Bacon movie “Death Sentence.” Gang kills dude’s son, dude mentally breaks, swears revenge, goes against entire gang somehow becoming Superman fighting a series of progressively harder evil characters until he gets to the “Final Boss.” Too unrealistic to be good. A clever idea that could have been better executed.. a John Wick/Nobody style movie where the main character never says a word. I enjoyed it but its not for everyone. You have to be too stupid to like this film I loved the idea of the movie, but it just didn't reach the potential that it had. Right of the back the main character has a run in with the bad guys getting blasted in this back and neck. By a miracle he is still alive but now a mute.  He then seeks revenge and trains to kill them all of X-mas.

One of my biggest pet peeves was him buying a car and lining it with bullet proof vest. Yet for some reason whenever his car was shot at all of the bullets bounced right off of the body and his glass windows for some odd reason. Everything was way over the top and just felt really bad and not thought out. There was another scene where a biker was chasing him down in his car. They go into an ally way and he pins the biker against his car and a building yet somehow the biker is fine and holding onto his sideview mirror. He then drivers the biker into a pole killing the biker that could of easily let go before then. I ended up turning the movie off with 28 minutes left. Think this is the first movie I've ever started and did not finish. i am flipping channels and this is one of the few movies i haven't seen but each time i try to see if it's worth watching......it's WAY tooooo s l o w and way tooooo silent! This was a cool movie. Reminiscent of the old silent movies of the 20s and 30s. It's gritty and raw. Some may not like it bc most ppl are socially ignorant and unable to read other ppl or take so much as a social cue. I thought this was pretty awesome. You really feel the emotion and the psychological aspects of what the characters are experiencing. A very bad idea! John Woo's Silent Night swings for the fences and misses completely. This was a half baked concept that might have seemed cool on paper but on film it falls completely on it's face. Silent Night does have some decent action here and there but even that is far from saving this bad film. It's a shame because I'm a really big John Woo fan and he is always coming up with great action flicks. This one just happens to be one of his minimal few ones. This action film is pretty much a silent film as it contains no dialogue at all from any of it's characters. Our main character seeks revenge on bad guys who had something to do with his son's death. While trying to save his son our hero damages his vocal chords so he can no longer speak. This sets up the premise of the film and let me tell you it gets very old after a while. Silent Night gets a low 1 1/2 stars out of 5. One word... Ridiculous! Completely unrealistic, no creativity, no dialogue, bad acting, pointless. If you waste your time on this, you were warned. Just wow! What an experience! A modern day silent film. The lack of dialogue heightened the perception of all the sounds to the max. All of the punches, kicks, gun shots, grunts and breaths are clearly heard and felt. 

The fight scenes were choreographed to perfection. Normally in action movies the protagonist cartoonishly outmatches the bad guys. In this film you see a much more realistic depiction of fights where the protagonist often gets hurt badly, but comes out on top because he really is that guy. 

Another excellent element of the film is the showcasing of how an average man transforms into a killing machine. Instead of simply entering the movie prepackaged with fighting/shooting skills, we get to see the training and progress it takes to become who he is. 

This feels more of like going on a ride at an amusement park than a movie, in the best way. This is an action movie that would be played in an art film festival. Opening scene already shows how bad this is.. first 4 minutes. Guy runs straight down an alley fleeing from a car. Gangsters in car can’t shoot him while he’s running in a straight line 15 ft away, then car runs into a forklift at the end of the alley that is completely visible, killing several in the vehicle of course. LOL WUT. It was just okay. Some moments were so unrealistic that I almost turned it off. Excellent action flick.  Maybe not as good as John Wick 4.  But more like John Wick 2 or 3.  Loved it. Took way too long to get to the action. When it finally did, it was enjoyable. Some cool action scenes but fails to leave a lasting impression or ever truly make you feel invested in any of the characters. The lack of dialogue is an interesting choice but falls flat on its face in my opinion. What a ride, I loved it! Gritty and stylish. Brought back the good times of John Woo. I want to see more of Joel Kinnaman as an action hero. Movie was awful.  Basically no dialogue and no connections to any of the characters in the movie outside the Father who lost his son.  Nothing was believable (from surviving getting shot in the throat), to who knows what the wife is up to or going through. Kid Cudi has no story to him aside from the ending.  Just a horrible movie. John Woo? Poo poo. They obviously saved money on script writers and no need for them in this movie as there was not one spoken word. They were trying to be clever and run the whole movie with no speech. There were parts in the movie at the beginning with his wife and in the end with the cop where they should have at least spoken. To not do so made the film ridiculous and could have been so much better. John Woo? Poo poo.

Action,the_marvels,"This narrative is pure comic book ridiculousness done correctly. The Marvels has its fair share of action and dramatic moments, but more than anything else this film strives to entertain the viewer. The Marvels could have been so much more, but with evident overproduction, nonsensical dialogue, bad editing, and a keen lack of vision to say anything substantive, it is yet another loss for Marvel Studios.  ... go along with all the talk about mysterious alien bangles, wormholes on the fritz, jump point surges, malfunctioning light-based powers ... Eventually, we land on a story about family, female friendship, and Flerkens ... It does go higher, and further, but puts a little too much stock in faster. Unlike the more recent superhero movies that are lengthy and burdened by questions about origin and identity, The Marvels is a breezy entertainer that does not doesn’t take itself too seriously... I thought the superhero fatigue was real for me, so much so that I completely opted out of Blue Beetle. But Disney does what it does, and since it insists on continuing its now sprawling universe, I couldn't help but be intrigued by The Marvels. The Marvels has its moments but can’t overcome the same old problems we’ve watched plague the MCU for years. No amount of body-switching gimmickry can save this film. If you want something a little bit on the more frivolous side for fun, give it a shot. Couldn't hurt. But it's hard to recommend to anybody who takes this stuff more seriously. Marvels” has a lot of bonkers, jump the shark moments that I loved and hated at the same time. There is a colorful, musical sequence; the Disneyfication of Captain Marvel, which really infuriated me and made me want to get a twirl to fully see the dress A superhero film so anxious to satisfy everyone, everywhere all at once, it ends up inciting dread whenever its foolish coven of superwomen are trying to act like people who like each other. The Marvels is as enjoyable as a turn in the pillory.  The cinematic superhero slide continues with this disappointing follow-up to the superior Captain Marvel. It’s a joy to watch these superwomen support and empower one another. The Marvels deserved more love than it got and is one of the more accessible, you don't *need* to have watched all/any of the other films to enjoy this science fiction romp following three super women as they team up to save the universe. The Marvels was a perfectly fine hour and forty-ish minutes, with some fun character interaction and some decent superhero action, the only issue is it just didn’t have the drive or gravitas to really pull me in. Not bad, but not great either.  This one has some truly weird sequences and the best use of “Memory” from Cats maybe ever in film history.  The weakest and least buzzed-about Marvel film in some time – and it’s a shame. There was such a big opportunity here and they blew it.  Unlike too many of its predecessors, this is a fast-moving and fun entry in the MCU. The Marvels is fine! Just fine. Don’t expect too much, and it won’t under-deliver.  Fans of MS. MARVEL (like me) should have a great time with this team-up because despite the heavier moments of Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau reuniting after decades apart, the bigger focus is on Kamala Khan meeting her idol. ","Possibly the worst movie in MCU. Extremely lame and boring movie. Quick villain build-up, boring boss battle, and halfway through I forgot what was keeping ""Captain"" Marvel motivated. Another fail, unfortunately. The ppl who made this movie, The writers, the directors, producers. Must have given up before this was made. All the reviewers that gave this anything above a half a star must have felt so bad for it. They gave it a mercy 5 our of 5 stars. Now lying isn't fair to the movie going audience. My grandma was fooled. She was really mad Falls fowl of the current Marvel phase of mediocrity.

The writing isn't great, the gimmick of switching places seems to be very inconsistent, sometimes they change other times they don't... 
Why there is a musical number part way through escapes me... 
The villain of the piece also feels forgettable with a weird motive that could easily have been solved by other means... 
Ms Marvel was a relatively interesting series with it's effects, but it feels like she skips through his film with an ability to read the room about as well as a blind man driving a car. Millennial humor. Marvel really took a turn for the worst with this one. If you want to understand why the ""mcu"" is the way it is today, this movie is the perfect summary. It Works Great As a ""Classic"" Superhero Story Not worth my time.  Plot is a mess. Absolute 🗑️. Poor writing acting and more. Extremely lame and boring movie.  This was a STINKER!  Quick villain build-up, boring boss battle, and halfway through I forgot what was keeping ""Captain"" Marvel motivated.  Another fail, unfortunately.  Bad way to end the year. A planet, where they speak English, but can’t understand you if you aren’t singing. That’s all that needs to be said. The entire thing felt like one big gimmick. Good visuals but super predictable story and very lame villain I didn't like it at all, I wouldn't recommend it Probably the worst movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I couldn't finish watching it...that's how bad it was. This is a very disappointing movie.  It features poor writing, lackluster performances, an unthreatening villain, plot holes you could drive a Kree destroyer through, cardboard characters, and a boatload of silliness that simply does not belong.

Why is there superhero fatigue and why are fans of the genre no longer going to these movies?  There are far too many like these in which ""the Marvel Way"" substitutes for any originality, heart, or creativity. The second worst marvel movie ever made, The Eternals being the worst.  

The Miss Marvel TV serves was fantastic. 

This was hot garbage

Dance routines and cats with mouth tendrils was as stupid as it gets, it deserves the lowest rating possible. I couldn't even call it as a Movie. The only reason i gave an one star is because that is the my last sympathy left on marvel. Movie was horrible. Why marvel thinks that public would like it if there has some using superpowers and some smashing scenes? They are knowing public as a some kind of moron? I have no idea why marvel made this thing.. Plz come back to the good old marvel.. A yawn fest of strung together, badly written scene from uncompeling C list Marvel charters built around one B list Character (Captain Marvel). 

I wonder if the scene in the film involving herds of cats was a metaphor for the whole film project? Pretty surprised by the high audience score. This was pretty slow paced and bad. Would've been better without the planet that sings everything but it's pretty good, with humor and action, and I don't get where all the hate is coming from!"
Action,die_hard,"Nothing lasts forever... except for this cinematic party that keeps welcoming us to one of the best action and christmas movies ever. 
[Full Review in Spanish] One of the most divisive holiday classics, the argument on whether John McTiernan's Die Hard is a Christmas movie, finds its way to the forefront every year. For myself, the truth is indisputable. Die Hard is a Christmas film - no, a Christmas classic. To say Die Hard still holds up is an understatement: charismatic protagonist and antagonist, great action set pieces, well paced and a top class finale. It’s no wonder so many other films and TV series continue to “do a Die Hard”, it’s still hard to top. Top to bottom, it is just endlessly entertaining and well-crafted with outstanding work from all involved. No matter how much action movies have continued to grow, this will always be the cinematic elder statesman that can scrap with the best of them. That’s right, I’m saying it, loudly and proudly, since John McTiernan’s 1988 action classic isn’t just set at Christmastime—it embodies the very spirit of the holiday. The gold standard for action filmmaking; what action movie tropes Die Hard doesn't follow, it reinvents or altogether originates, and all of them have yet to be bettered. Give Die Hard a fresh spin this year; it's the most joyous Christmas film of all!  I really appreciated the interpersonal relationship between him and his wife. It wasn't slow but it was taking its time. [It] may be the best action movie EVER. It's another anti-cheer holiday selection, but one that keeps on giving - rewatchable sans saturation... Sometimes-more often than not, even- a script with many hands on it becomes a case of too many cooks. With Die Hard, competing experienced creatives produced a film that works on multiple levels. Still the prototype of the modern action yarn -- its status was secured so rapidly that subsequent action romps were invariably described as ""Die Hard on a train / plane / bus / zeppelin / tricycle / what-have-you."" Die Hard is not only an excellent action film, it is an excellent film overall and its ability to stand the test of time and still hold up is admirable. A spectacularly thrilling film, possessing enough brains to match its brawn. The picture is extremely violent: bombs go off, bullets rip through flesh, heads are slammed against steel. But Die Hard is also smart, satirical-and, in an odd way, heartwarming. The director's spectacular ability to compose the plans and take advantage of the full range of the panoramic format possibilities. [Full Review in Spanish] It's a glorious scene-stealer for Alan Rickman, though it's a credit to Willis's cheeky charisma that his scene is not in fact stolen. Die Hard is a great example of the Hollywood studio system getting moviemaking right - the film is a perfect storm of story and talent coming together. Die Hard still feels as fresh and thrilling as the first time it screened. From the superb pacing through to the sarcastically sinister villainy of Alan Rickman, this remains a crucial template for the modern action film.","Die Hard is an action packed thrill ride from start to finish

Duração: 2h 11m	Ano: 1988
Minha opinião: Este filme lança Bruce Willis ao estrelato de Hollywood. Mas ele não foi a 1ª opção. Tiveram antes Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Richard Gere e o 10º foi Willis. Quem imaginária outro MacClane, não sendo Willis. Temos o 1º Duro de Matar (1988), 2º Duro de Matar 2 (1990), A Vingança (1995), Duro de Matar 4.0 (2007), Um Bom Dia para Morrer (2013). O filme se passa no dia da véspera de Natal no prédio Nakatomi, onde sua esposa ou quase esposa Holly (Bedelia) trabalha na corporação. E por um engano vão buscar John no aeroporto para participar da festa dos Nakatomi. E o prédio é invadido por ladrões fortemente armados para roubar o cofre do prédio. O líder é Hans (Rickman) e eles faze reféns todos os que estão no prédio menos John. E para salvar todos MacClane. Ele busca ajuda, mas só caras que ao invés de ajudar, atrapalham a não ser Sgt. Ai. E a cada passo John eliminando os ladrões e frustrando seu plano. A coisa pega fogo e eles mandam ver com bazucas. Até o moneto que eles descobrem seu verdadeiro nome. E colocam Holly como refém. Então John tem que fazer de tudo para sava-la. E com muitas explosões e tiros, faz a marca de Duro de Matar e John MacClane. É claro que temos um final feliz. Este filme é mais light entre ação e não ação, tendo muito diálogo. Como disse aqui foi registrado o DNA do estilo de filme.
Roteiro e enredo interessante por passar em um edifício e não sendo o filme de chamas.
Vale apena assistir? Sim 
Nota: 8 por ser o 1º da série. The number one absolute best movie ever made the greatest masterpiece ever Bruce Willis gives out an exciting and action-packed performance in DIE HARD, a movie that will surely keep you glued to the screen every single minute. What can I say? This film is an absolute action classic. I saw it in the theater when it came out in '88.

The cinematography is brilliant and the storyline is great. Alan Rickman is wonderful and of course, Bruce Willis is entertaining as ever. Few action movies suck you into their world like Die Hard. I recomment it 100%. My all-time favorite film that I can watch over and over without getting bored. Definitely worth a watch, one of the better Christmas and action movies (somehow at the same time?) Whether you think it's a Christmas movie or not, this is just an awesome movie. Real classic 80s/90s action and scripting. Pretty much perfect. Best movie on earth. Awesome action sequences, a great main lead and villain, some refreshing payoff, and great christmas elements, makes die hard one of the greatest action and christmas movies of all time. Definitely worth a watch and is a Christmas film Die Hard R (nudity and killing) - Action and mystery 
Action 
Police With every new viewing, you can get a better appreciation of how expertedly crafted this movie is. An all-time classic and a true masterpiece. Definitely a classic action flick.
But seriously, couldn't they engage real German speakers to play the German baddies. ""Schieße den Fenster!"" yeah sure...
And as much as I like Alan Rickman, I'm pretty sure Jürgen Prochnow would've made the better German villain. This one makes for me the ""Great Action Trio"" as i call it alongside Rambo First Blood and Mad Max: Fury Road. Absolute perfection. die hard is the best action movie ever. yes, i mean it A little less fun every time you see it Die Hard is the greatest Christmas of all time. John McClane is just the perfect hero you love to root for, and is one of the greatest film heroes ever. He's not some huge Arnold Schwarzenegger tank that can flick people's heads off. He's just a normal cop that's trying to fix his failed relationship with his wife, so he can spend Christmas with his wife and kids. He's not sent on a mission to take out these terrorists, he's just the person with the right set of skills that finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, and does the right thing because even though he's not perfect, he's a good person. Bruce Willis plays him wonderfully. Hans Gruber is also one of the greatest movie villains ever, and is played brilliantly by Alan Rickman. He's just the perfect classic Christmas villain, motivated by greed. The humor in this works incredibly well, as the film is just filled with hilarious quotes from John McClane, Hans Gruber, Theo, and Argyle. The cast just has great chemistry, because it's not just individual lines that great, but also the banter the characters share. This also filled with great action set pieces and fights that are awesome to watch. The film is very iconic with moments and lines like John McClane crawling through the vents, or ""Yippee Ki-Yay (you know the rest)."" The film also sets everything up perfectly, like John McClane not having shoes and later being forced to walk on glass, or just the small moment at the end where Al shoots the terrorist that has to make everyone cheer everytime. This isn't only my favorite Christmas and action movie ever made, but this is just one of my favorite movies period. I love this movie. I didn't realise it until it started kicking off but this is my kind of movie. The plot is really good and engaging, action is great and an interesting villain."
Action,the_oath_2023,"It feels like a biblical epic. I know there is an audience for this because it is an old-fashioned action-adventure. It is low budget, so there is not a whole lot of CGI. It is a story of survival. A jumble of abbreviated action and stilted storytelling that, I’m guessing, will leave neither the movie’s built-in audience — members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — or anyone else satisfied. The Oath is a faith-based movie about Judeo-Christian historical people, but this tedious drama is actually very soulless. The characters, story, and filmmaking are woefully generic, while the acting performances are dismally substandard. There are some well done elements throughout the film, but there are also moments where things collapse from the pressure. At various points resembling “Gladiator,” “The Passion of the Christ,” “Dances with Wolves,” “The Last of the Mohicans,” and “Braveheart,” “The Oath” mixes elements of drama, action, romance, and fantasy to stirring effect. I appreciate the filmmakers' intentions, but pledging to watch 'The Oath' may cause severe regrets. It's certainly no sillier in any way that I could see than, say, Conan the Barbarian or the Lord of the Rings flicks. And it's at least as heartfelt. The fact that in terms of subject matter this is an unusual film doesn’t mean it’s a good one... it’s solemn, repetitive and unexciting.  Clunky, dull and undercooked while very low on thrills, suspense and emotional depth.  A limp, underfinanced Pre-Columbian “Last of the Mohicans” action adventure...and a dull MesoAmerican thriller built on Mormonism’s foundation myth, with just enough magical thinking thrown in to make everything presented here play as eye-rolling hokum.","I watched this for the live GAM show and God AWFUL movies is right. I could go on for days about this movie, but I’ll let them do their thing Saturday. Cheers to Mormon movie month always being good for some hilariously bad films with surprisingly good production quality.  At the end of all of it I only have 4 remaining questions that I’m even remotely invested in: 

1) are we all agreeing that dude totally gutted his recently murdered wife to confirm he was having a son. 

2) are we all agreeing that big sis is a shapeshifting werewolf and we’re pissed we didn’t get to watch that movie? 

3) if we’re supposed to know (and no way would you get this from the movie) that dude becomes the angel Moroni, then who is the younger, better looking, golden armor wearing angel that pops in twice with no lines? 

4) what the hell did Billy Zane do that someone has evidence of to be blackmailed into participating in this movie? Okay, first of all this has more of the feel of a short film so don't expect an epic like Braveheart. This is a period film based in the Americas prior to it's discovery by the Vikings or Christopher Columbus. The Book of Mormon - Another Testament of Jesus Christ is listed as one of the most influential books ever published in America. It is the first attempt at a serious film by a promising new Director so do not expect this to be like most modern films or television programs, which seem to always hit every checkmark and of course, it doesn't feel super slick ""Hollywood blockbuster"" yet all to often lacking any real passion or feeling. This an independent film and it feels like it, which is a good thing--as it maintains passion with a gritty, and natural feel. Of course, if you can you can get over not getting overloaded with the typical fare and just sit back, relax and, of course even better if you have read the Book of Mormon you'll more fully appreciate the cultures and people and included therein--or even if you haven't just use your imagination of what it may have been like to live another time and place, and enjoy this as one artist's passionately and creatively-crafted interpretation of a very brief moment, again it feels more like a short film which I personally enjoyed even more the second and third time watching it. Personally, I love all genres and types of film and series this one is an underrated treat that deserves a little patience and appreciation for what it is a sweet story of love, survival and sacrifice. Again, not an epic film and a unique perhaps acquired taste of what an artist with a passion can create with nothing but a love of the subject matter and characters can accomplish without big money or funding. Definitely looking forward to seeing more from this filmmaker in the future! I think it was deceptive to not let the audience know it was about the book of Mormon. Poorly executed, low budget fare. Donated to this movie production and couldnt be more disappointed. What a wasted opportunity. Seriously. Does anyone have the courage to tell Darin this was an epic fail? He wont even break even when  this is all said and done. I want to tell you about my reaction to the movie. I'm embarrassed to say I wasn't expecting it to be as polished or professional as a typical Hollywood blockbuster. This week is not only the Christmas-New Year week, it is also my birthday (December 26) and my wife's birthday (today, December 29). So, I took the day of work to celebrate. Last night Minda & I went to see ""Boys in the Boat"" and found it to be a wonderful movie, though very formulaic. I'd enthusiastically recommend it to anyone—expecially to families or other groups who want to learn to achieve greater success by working harmoniously and seamlessly. But, like I said, we chose to go see The Oath not because we expected to see a great film, but more because we like to support ""Mormon art"", excuse the expression.

Boy was I wrong.

There is nothing formulaic about The Oath and yet it presents a coherent, powerful, and beautifully told story. It is obvious that anyone who could have written the screenplay and directed this movie knows The Book of Mormon very well, loves The Book of Mormon, and has a fervent conviction of the veracity of that ancient work. Since I first read The Book of Mormon at age 15 (and at least once a year on the average since that time (I'm now 71) I've often pondered what life might have been like for Moroni after his father and all his kinsfolk had died (or deserted to join the Lamanites). Surely Moroni was hunted and no doubt had a price on his head. Anyone who's read Moroni's account realizes he was noble, bold, physically fit, of a keen intellect, and had a tender heart. Your movie portrays Moroni masterfully. It also posits a truly plausible tale of what Moroni's later life might have been like.The story moves along quickly and though it has all the compelling elements of a top-notch action movie it is more believable than any action movie I've ever seen. I wouldn't be surprised if your tale turns out to be what actually happened to Moroni. Maybe. Maybe not. But if nothing else, it is definitely a very realistic and believable touchstone of Latter-day Saint culture.

You were wonderfully imaginative in deciding to make this movie. I'm sure you (and others) prayed diligently for inspiration and guidance once you determined to go ahead and actually embark on the work. Your prayers were heard. I am often a critic of what I call an ""ego-trip movies"" where the main star is also the writer and director. Such movies are almost always dismal failures...hokie to the extreme. Take WaterWorld and Yentl, for example. I don't see any ego getting in the way of The Oath, however. I think only a bold, creative, and humble soul could have had the vision and drive to accomplish such a magnificent work as your film, The Oath. You were exactly the right age and had the right physique and the right look as well as the right mannerisms to pull off your portrayal of Moroni. Your background (such as your role in Ephraim's Rescue) and working with top professionals obviously helped you prepare and helped you get the connections needed to be successful.

When the man (I forgot his name) who gave Handel the Bible verses that formed the libreto for Handel's ""Messiah"" witnessed the completed production, he told George Frederick Handel that he ""made very good entertainment out of it"". Handel responded that he'd be very disappointed ""if I only entertained them. I intended to make them better."" Congratulations on making a film that makes us want to be better—while entertaining us profoundly. Congratulations on a gargantuan work of art so well done! Love it.  True to the story. A lot of the movie is made up to help the story along but that's not a bad thing. Amazing movie... Loved it The story is fictional and very creative.  The music and message are powerful, and the acting is believable and well done.  This is an unconventional movie, and of much higher quality morally than most of what is out there.  We saw it twice! :) I wanted to like this film so bad. I even donated to the cause. It was slow, boring and anticlimactic. It felt like it was trying too hard. Marriage was portrayed as a cheap thing that anyone can do just by speaking words to each other. Disappointed. Why does this whole thing now remind me of “the emperor’s new clothes?” It seems like nobody close to Darin wants to be brave and tell him the truth about this film. It seems like everyone is afraid to criticize it because the perceived wisdom is that just because Darin is a good guy, no one should offer any rebuttal. I really enjoyed this movie! A Great storyline to fill in the gaps of history. It told a story of Love, dedication, sacrifice, and devotion in something bigger than self. I will watch it again to see what I missed the first time. I have been waiting for this movie for so long and I was curious to see if it could live up to the expectations. I was pleasantly surprised and loved everything about it. Powerful book and powerful message. I thought the Oath was way better than the SHIFT which we ere also excited to see but was not that great. The Oath was GREAT! Unexpected, I loved it! They need to make more like this.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ They made it sound like it was based on a true story. It was more like a rewritten Gladiator and then they tried to make more sales using the same approach as The Sound of Freedom. They could have and should have just not made any connection to the Book of Mormon and it would have been a lot better. This movie was terrible.  I even helped by donating money to get it made.  It was weird, boring, and the storyline was very off from any historical facts from what the Book of Mormon teaches.  I was disappointed and wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time or money on this. We very much enjoyed the movie - ""The Oath"" exceeded our expectations!  Great scenery, excellent story with action to accentuate the narrative.  Must see! Close, but no cigar.  Am very familiar with the story.  The Book of Mormon is a treasure trove of great material, all uplifting.  A better writer, maybe a different setting. Darin tried to do everything himself, and failed.  
Hope someone keeps trying. This is clearly a historical fiction. Of course this takes some creative liberty with the love story, which initially made me a little uncomfortable, but I can see why he took this approach. Given Moroni was alone at the end of the Nephite era, this was a unique way to try to tell his story as who else would he talk to? I would have liked to see more of the historical context, but this take does do a pretty decent job of representing the character of Moroni and enough reference to portray the brutality of the time. I think a perfectly accurate portrayal of the Book of Mormon would be rated R for violence, but I think this depiction was tastefully done to give the idea but keep it family friendly. Great music and pretty good acting and cinematography for a lower budget film. The show was very well done. I liked the way It showed that a prophet could face the temptations the natural man and still uphold his promises. So so so so bad. It was incredibly boring, and felt inappropriate and sacrilegious at times. The acting was terrible, and you can tell that the director (who is also the writer and main actor) was trying really hard to make this a deep and moving movie. All of it felt forced, and uninspiring. I honestly wish we would have left the theater early. But we both love the Book of Mormon, and kept holding onto hope that it'd get better.  My husband and I left with an empty feeling inside. We had to go home and watch something else to lift our spirits. The only thing that was decent was the music. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time and money. Beautiful cinematography and an interesting story line. I hope that more movies of this caliber are produced in the future."
Action,fast_charlie,"The film thrives on a relaxed pace, blending action and dark comedy. But it is a double-edged sword; while it keeps Fast Charlie from becoming too grim, it also makes some scenes feel off-kilter and less impactful. A bit of an odd one, an action-comedy throwback that doesn’t quite know what it wants to be. Still, it bodes well for Pierce Brosnan’s new phase as a grey-haired action star. This crime tale uses many familiar elements, but, under the guidance of director Phillip Noyce, it feels crisp, fleet-footed, and spirited, adding up to a solid, entertaining B-movie.  'Fast Charlie' is made up entirely of shrugs and sighs, and is a pathetic genre attempt set in the humid Deep South.  ... there’s this sly humor that venomously assesses the lack of morality in the Southern mob lands. The dark comedy in Fast Charlie can get a little dicey and off-kilter, but this crime caper has a winning performance from Pierce Brosnan as a world-weary assassin. It's a violent movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has some funny surprises. With Mr. Brosnan in the driver’s seat, Fast Charlie is a slick throwback, filled with action and the sharp lifestyle of being a hitman. A pretty watchable B-movie if you're bored on a Friday night with no parties to go to. And a potential franchise if it makes money. Pierce Brosnan has a wry sense of humor in this slick and violent piece of pulp entertainment. Phillip Noyce’s well-seasoned, blood-splattered throwback, a smooth ride that doesn’t wear out its welcome at a brisk 90 minutes. In addition to setting the scene gorgeously on the Gulf Coast, director Phillip Noyce knows how to keep things moving slickly. And he also finds ways to reveal internal motivations in characters even when things get silly. A weird noir that has so many permutations that even when you see them coming, they're italicized so you feel fondly towards all the tropes.  Pierce Brosnan drops his Irish elocution for a Southern twang in a breezy crime thriller with unexpected dark humor. Fast Charlie isn't extraordinary but has solid action, good cast chemistry, and enough macabre chuckles to warrant a recommendation. “Fast Charlie” doesn’t break any new ground in the genre, but it’s the sort of engaging escapade that Hollywood used to turn out with ease.  The movie adds little that's new to the tough-guy redemption genre — apart from a dead raccoon and some tasty tomato sauce — but it does revolve around the always likable Pierce Brosnan, who plays the courtly but dangerous Charlie Swift. Brosnan brings his brand of sly, flirtatious, reluctant heroism to the role. He and Baccarin make a good May/December pairing. Caan's last film. Talented collaborators on both sides of the camera have done better than this far-fetched Deep South crime thriller, although it intermittently rises above the formulaic fray. This is the farthest thing in the cinematic firmament from a world-changer you can imagine, but as an evening’s entertainment, it’ll more than do. The fact that Brosnan and Baccarin make us believe ... their ... strange relationship ... makes the material feel less routine than it could have been. The real motor that sustains Fast Charlie for the duration of its breezy 90-minute running time is the will-they won’t-they romance between Brosnan and Baccarin, both actors cultivating a palpable sense of intimacy.","Pierce still has it. I really liked the movie. Hitman story with James Cann in it. Marcie's character was too young for him. But the story kept moving and it was enjoyable to watch. If you love Pierce Brosnan (as Charlie). You have to see it. Pierce Brosnan does it again as a problem solver seeking revenge on an up incoming gangster that screwed with the wrong man. A great Farewell to the Legend James Caan. Good movie. Really enjoyed it. Great story with a great ending. I enjoyed the whole movie. Not a lot of surprises, but very well done. Good story, OK acting but loosing a big chunk of points on the ""standard/low budget tv-movie"" feel and filming.
Better postproduction could have improved somewhat! Pierce Brosnan is still Fierce. One of his best performances yet, after a few minutes I stopped seeing the Brosnan I've known for three decades and completely saw Charlie Swift. That's no mean feat for a Bond actor. Supported brilliantly by Baccarin and James Caan. Brilliant score too. Seen this movie multiple times and it feels stronger with every view. Think it's the slow slow burn of the love affair that makes it all work. I absolutely loved this movie. Watched it a week and a half ago and then over the Easter break, watched it a couple more times. I would never have thought to put this set of actors together but the outcome is greater than the sum of its parts. Really wonderful. How this film has such good reviews baffles me! Tired plot with no twists and little thrills. Don't waste your time with this turkey. I thought the start with its outrageous dark comedy was just about perfect. Sort of let down when it got serious later on, but the slow burn of the love affair pulled me in. Messy start trying to be funny but failing, then much better second half. Cliché story that could have been better. Overall, could have been a much better and believable story if the co-star female character was 60+. Good film, like the story and a nice watch. I absolutely loved this movie. Big fan of Morena Baccarin from Gotham and Deadpool but this has to be one of her best performances of her career by far! Completely underrated. Empire Podcast has all the crazy of Fast Charlie. Gotta check it out. Best story from Empire Podcast was about everyone thinking Jimmy Caan was truly suffering from dementia and that they were shooting a documentary. Only as soon as he completed his last shot Mr Caan suddenly became full of energy and intellectual vitality and cracking jokes. He'd been in total acting method on and off the set while shooting. u gotta listen to the Empire Podcast interview with the director of this film. Hilarious tales of the best daredevil seat of your pants independent filmmaking.Beyond Terry Gilliam antics. This one sets the bar for madness and it actually ran the gauntlet to escape to the world as a brilliant film. Wow. Finally Fast Charlie opening next week in Uk on Amazon. If u want action you will find it better elsewhere.  If u want scope, this film will disappoint.  But if u want the most delicate relationship u will see on screen for the last 12 months, go watch Pierce Brosnan and Morena Baccarin in this movie. Magical. This movie so reminded me of one of my 70s faves..Charley Varrick, directed by the great Don Siegel. And starring Walter Matthau in a  crime movie that's totally entertaining, like Fast Charlie. Right down to the action finale in the car junkyard. This was alright, not particularly as thrilling as I was hoping. It was kinda comical to watch Brosnan struggling with that yankee-doodle accent that seemed rather intermittent! I was hoping for a bit more action, I guess. The movie was okay…similar to other movies in the genre of hitman fighting back against the crime boss who wronged him.  It just wasn't as compelling or interesting- plus I had a hard time getting past Pierce Brosnan's fake Southern accent. That caused a lot of eye-rolling in our house."
Action,concrete_utopia,"As allegories go, it is a bit heavy-handed, but Um's totalising vision in terms of imagery, soundscape and performances can't be faulted.  At its most political, Concrete Utopia finds the fascist project essentially anti-life and destined for a systemic collapse. Eom's supple film shows the best and worst of human nature, often displayed by the same people Powered by Lee Byung-hun’s performance and truly outstanding production design, Concrete Utopia finds its own niche in the recent spate of social satire thrillers. Its way of surprising us shows that it's aimed more at entertainment than at exploration, and manages to be quite effective in its purpose. [Full review in Spanish] Far from being a project in love with its own worldbuilding, Concrete Utopia is far more focused on the social drama and practicality of being a survivor in a destroyed city that used to house ten million living people. If George Orwell had had a career stint as a Korean estate agent, this is the kind of story he might have turned out. Concrete Utopia stands out for its spectacular production design, which combines scenic realism with a wide array of VFX and camera movements. [Full review in Spanish]  It’s not a particularly upbeat look at one possible grim near-future, but it is an entertaining one. A survival story with excellent visual effects - a flashback with Min-sung stands out, in which we see what the boy was doing just when the cataclysm began -, solid performances, and a lot to say about human cruelty. Full review in Spanish. A very intelligent dramaturgy solidifies the mortar, finished off by the irony that transforms the pieces of a chess game... [Full review in Spanish] Concrete Utopia fulfills its disturbing purpose: to wonder what could happen to the human race when the worst instincts emerge amid the urgency to rebuild society from its foundation. [Full review in Spanish] ... More of a social drama than a catastrophe film, like those seen in the '70s. [Full review in Spanish] With a powerful narrative and a portentous design, Concrete Utopia transports us to an apocalyptic dystopia as desolate as it is recognizable... [Full review in Spanish] Without a focal idea to build toward, Concrete Utopia is more of a cinematic experiment than a film. The filmmakers certainly weigh many heavy topics with skillful immediacy.  With brilliant performances and a balanced, harrowing story to propel it, Concrete Utopia isn’t just one of the best films of the year: it may be the best disaster thriller in years. Um turns what could have been one more post-apocalyptic thriller into an intriguing challenge of a movie. Concrete Utopia holds us in its grip. Concrete Utopia remains emotionally convincing despite being ideologically hollow. Director Um is nothing if not fiercely committed to his dystopian gimmick, for better or worse, and his actors follow suit.  A natural disaster of such magnitude might never happen, but a societal one as depicted here increasingly seems too close for any comfort. Concrete Utopia is hardly the first disaster movie in which panic trumps morality. But this vision of a “utopia” smashed to pieces is more disturbing and believable than most.","Really good show!!!
I loved it so much, it was such an amazing experience with my favourite artists. Entertaining enough but a bit of a disappointment given the stellar reviews, the story/action/etc wasn't as compelling as you'd hope and the social commentary wasn't as nuanced either. Was a bit reluctant about this but have to say it was very good. Great character development and dialogue. Really loved it.  Korea has put out some really good quality stuff lately which is more than I can say for Hollywood which seems to be in decline. Buena, pero con algunos espacios muy vacíos Lo que hace creíble este drama de desastres es el enfocarse en los esfuerzos de los supervivientes, que en la causa del cataclismo. Los niveles de desconfianza y paranoia no son para nada fantasiosos y por eso es digna de crédito. Buena opción para un fin de semana Una historia fuera de lo que podría ser la realidad. La película tiene puntos muertos y lentos. Finaliza con un buen cierre. No esperaba mucho, mínimo fuera con lógica y abierta con este nuevo ""mundo"". The movie asks the audience whether you would do the same if your home were the only place to survive a colossal disaster and non-residents were to flood in. It is unclear which decision is the wisest, as that question is left unanswered even after the film's 129-minute running time. One can't tell whether the unsettled feeling after the film is simply due to the genre's characteristics as a dystopian flick.
""Concrete Utopia"" doesn't simply show Koreans' fantasies about owning an apartment or the loss of humanity in extreme situations. Rather, it invites discussion about humans' problematic desires and behaviors, including: greed, discrimination, the desire for power and human-made hierarchies.
Park Seo-joon and Park Bo-young show well-balanced acting, firmly supporting Lee Byung-hun, who once again fantastically portrays a complex, multi-dimensional character as the story unfolds.
Director Um's clever opening sequence showing what apartments mean in Korean society elevates the audience's understanding of the film's tone and style, making the film's topic accessible and relatable to moviegoers anywhere. While the narrative unfolds at a measured pace, it gradually reaches a satisfying climax, maintaining a steady and well-crafted quality. The actors deliver consistent performances, and the low to mid-budget apocalyptic scenes are handled with precision. This movie shows the human nature when authority is missing in excellent resolution, and makes clear the idea that social contract is important but is still  a very fragile concept. Entertaining flick. Disaster movie? Not exactly. Post-apocalyptic film? Maybe. Human kind in extreme conditions; that's when the real persons of every one come afloat Very interesting and heart-breaking Lord-of-the-Flies type of movie that explorers to what lengths we will go to live well at the expense of others. I think it was a very well-crafted exploration of tough choices and their consequences. And perhaps a profound look at how our views of ownership separate us from others and wellbeing for all. Pessimo muito ruim ! Mostrando como o ser humano pode ser frio, quando o assunto é sobrevivencia. Com algumas reviravoltas, faz vocêse questionar se esta do lado certo da historia Saw this movie five months ago and am still thinking about how much I enjoyed it and how I wish it made the Oscar nominations. Concrete Utopia is an amazing disaster movie set in Seoul Korea. A massive earthquake has occurred and there is only one standing apartment complex in all of the city left standing. How will they live? Defend themselves? How many others survived? The production value and moreover acting is great. It's a satisfying flick! It's standard post apocalyptic fare about humanity, but it's appropriate viewing right now. ""Concrete Utopia"" is a Korean movie that left me speechless. The film tells a gripping story filled with intense action sequences and unexpected twists. The performances by the cast are outstanding, bringing the characters to life with depth and emotion. The cinematography is visually stunning, capturing the gritty atmosphere of the urban setting. This movie is a rollercoaster of emotions, keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. If you're a fan of thrilling and suspenseful films, ""Concrete Utopia"" is a must-see! Fantastic film, provocative story telling.  Park Seo Joon gives a performance that is on another level, so moving and nuanced. Even the song during the credits was beautiful and touching. Once again Korean cinema shows it knows it stuff.  This is a deftly crafted and well directed movie that pulls no punches when exposing man's darker side. I suppose the biggest message to be had from this is that humanity is great when writ small; collectively, however, we stink. The cinematography is impressive also. I have seen plenty of post-apocalyptic and war films before but none has captured sheer desolation and abject devastation like this. Riveting movie! Great special effects and scenery. The three main actors engaged the audience without a lot of dialog.  Much of  the story was told  through  their emotions."
Action,indiana_jones_and_the_dial_of_destiny,"Dial of Destiny maintains an appreciative understanding of its protagonist and legacy while comfortably being its own thing in scale, stakes and excitement. For what was promised to be one last adventure, the stakes never reach full potential in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and emotions don’t run as high as needed to elevate the sentiment that this film is eagerly attempting to tap into. There’s a very distinct lack of Spielberg magic, but Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a decently entertaining “greatest hits” adventure. Replete with exoticism, Orientalism, and a nonsense science fiction plotline, Dial of Destiny proves the case for why this entire franchise belongs in a museum.  “Dial of Destiny” is just Indy being Indy and nobody does it better than Ford. ugly, prosaic and dull DIAL OF DESTINY..panders to an audience willing to be spoon-fed lines that they once recognised and moves as gracefully as its geriatric lead From a thrilling opening act, where Indy takes on a Nazi loot train, to a wild and wacky chase through Tangiers, Dial of Destiny proves the old grave robber can still deliver the goods.  Post-2016, Indy’s renown disgust over Nazis feels urgent and relevant, and the film does a subtle job of condemning the US for embracing and elevating Nazis over its now obsolete and forgotten heroes, WWII veterans and anyone who resisted the Nazis.  Far too long, but a somewhat fun time at the movies But ""better than Crystal Skull"" is a miserably low bar to clear. Dial's plot is surprisingly dumb, considering it took four screenwriters (including David Koepp and director James Mangold) to write it. I think you can find fun here. I think you can find good here. It's just not going to turn you around if you come in thinking it's a bad idea. Dial of Destiny is a fun ride, especially for moviegoers like me who just want to enjoy some nostalgia as we contemplate a retirement full of watching all those films we’ve collected over the years. There's a lot that's fun here... but the more you look at the CG, the more it looks like The Polar Express. There wasn't a world wherein this film would capture the greatness of the original trilogy but it's nice to see Indy and his compatriots sent off in fine, if unspectacular, fashion.  At the end of the day, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny may not be the best installment of Indiana Jones, but it certainly fits perfectly within the saga, committing to its characters and its essence. [Full review in Spanish] A beautiful send-off for this character. He steps back into that fedora not like he’s never left it, which is the point. He meets his character where he actually is – old, alone, grieving.  And while the story is bombastic, is still better than aliens. With that in mind, I'll give the film a B-, its not perfect, but if you settle in, you can enjoy one last adventure. Despite the weirdly ambivalent headlines and mixed reviews dogging this film since its bow at Cannes, this is one of the most consistently enjoyable legacy sequels of recent years. It’s fun; it’s wacky; it works.","After much anticipation, I finally had the opportunity to watch this movie, despite purchasing it some time ago. The beginning of the film was quite impressive, featuring a de-aged Harrison Ford. However, after transitioning to 1969, the film's quality unfortunately declined significantly.

The acting in the CGI-laden film was abysmal, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge's performance standing out as the worst of all. The movie should have concluded the Indiana Jones saga with The Last Crusade, as that film provided a more satisfying ending. Unfortunately, the entire cast delivered subpar performances, detracting from the film's potential.

The film squandered its potential due to lackluster filmmaking and acting, resembling a poorly made fan film. The story was uninspired and unimaginative, resulting in a lazy and unengaging narrative.

It is incomprehensible how this film managed to receive an 88% score. Among all the Indiana films, this one stands out as the worst. Mesma receitinha de bolo dos anteriores, para rememorar os velhos tempos, nada de novo em meio as ações e a trilha sonora inesquecível, só… Gostosinho, legalzinho, bem produzido, ótimos cenas de ação, eu gosto de antiguidades, eles tentaram, válido o esforço coletivo, tem algumas boas tiradas de humor enferrujado, Harrison Ford está um adorável canastrão mal-humorado cativante, Mediano e regular... More Disney vandalization of a once-beloved franchise. If you loved the originals, this will only make you angry. Not sure who the intended audience is here. I have almost zero faith in audience scores now as there’s no way this legitimately scored 88%. No way in ….. this movie has an 88% audience score. Just ain’t no way. I just watched it for the first time this evening. July 22, 2024. I put off watching it cause it’s exactly that I thought it would be. A let down. Indy ended when they rode off into the sunset in the last crusade. I like ford and mangold as they’ve made some great film but this ain’t it. The cgi just looked so fake, even sets just looked like sets. The first 20 mins where they do young Indy I feel like I’m watching a video game cut scene the whole time, they kept old man fords voice for 40 year old fords face lol not even surprised it bombed in the theatre. I found the movie to be just okay; it didn't quite live up to the standards set by other films. The lead actor didn't bring his usual flair to the role, and the plot felt somewhat lacking. Additionally, the absence of the main character's son as the heir to the Indiana Jones legacy was disappointing, especially since the character was killed off by the writer. It almost seemed like the movie had been planned for release a few years earlier, but the writers were unsure of how to conclude the story. it was terrible... NOT indiana jones at all... 

bad... just bad.... It's great to see Ford return to the role again. While not the best of the series, the film is very entertaining, true to form, and a fitting finish. Indy kept me on the edge of my seat. The film also features lots of great callbacks to previous films and makes me wish there had been more! Le scénario est incohérent, rempli de facilités. En fait, c'est si incohérent que ça en devient drôle. Impossible de rentrer dans le film à cause de cela. Ça se regarde difficilement mais c'est tout de même sympa de retrouver Indiana Jones au cinéma. De bonne notes d'humour. It could have been a great movie, but the producers did everything possible to age Indiana Jones more than necessary and give more prominence to the character of Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Helen Shaw), who is much more unpleasant than Mutt (Shia Labeouf) was in the previous film.
It would have much been better to use another character from the Jones family or hire another actor to reprise Mutt. If South Park thought the last Indy movie raped Indiana Jones, this one is digging up his corpse and defiling it in the same way.  There is no way this is deserving of an 88% audience score.  I don't believe that for a second.  You know what's worse than review bombing that no one talks about?  Review inflating.  Where studios pay unscrupulous companies to use bots to give fake 10/10 or 5/5 reviews to make a movie seem way better than it really is, because the studio doesn't care if you like it after taking your movie ticket money. I thought the story was ok. The ending was really cool, wish they were there for a bit longer and they could have had the story mostly there. Would have made for a crazy film. But you get what you get. The parts where Indys friend dies I thought could have been filmed better. Very poor. An unfortunate misfire. Tries to recreate the magic of Raiders but basically fails due to bad editing, unconvincing CGI, and a story arc that is dull and makes no sense whatsoever. The humor is forced, and the ending is just bizarre. The one redeeming feature is the young Harrison Ford. That was kind of amazing how they did that. The popular franchise that made Indiana Jones it's name completely goes off the rails in this film.  it just isn't my favorite of Indy's franchise.  it's not bad but the first three in the indiana jones canon are my favorite movies of all time.  This one puts a sour taste on indy's popularity. Awful movie. The plot seems to be all over the place and very bad writing. What is though most annoying, is the fact that for a whole movie named Indiana Jones, Dr Jones is discredited constantly and not because it makes sense in the story, but only for the replacement character that lacks character to look good. There were many opportunities that could allow Indiana Jones to excel in some scenes based on his knowledge, experience and veteran status, and in some physical aspects to appear as the old man he is and depict the inevitable fact everyone is growing old, while the new character could be the opposite. But no, again Disney had to bring the female character who is better at everything than Indiana Jones in an Indiana Jones movie, and honestly made him obsolete. He could easily just not be in the film and nothing would change. As a long-time fan and admirer of the franchise, I was pleasantly surprised at this entry.  Great plot line, with interesting references and the story moves along nicely. Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny was a great send off to Harrison Ford’s iteration of Indiana Jones. The movie was packed with action and I enjoyed the introduction of the new characters. I do think they coulda trimmed some of it, cause it seemed longer than it needed to be. I hope they give this franchise a rest and then reboot it in like 5-10 years. Definitely worth the rental. Movie kept you engaged. Storyline was good and fast paced.  Better than I expected given Ford’s age. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and a great way to end the series. It’s a definite watch. God awful film, the opening 20 mins were alright then it decends into chaos Damn, was hoping for a good movie.... this is isn't it."
Action,the_fall_guy_2024,"It’s a testament to Leitch’s energy as a director that the consistent action doesn’t become tiresome because there’s always something to enjoy and appreciate on the screen, whether it’s a choreographed brawl or someone being set on fire multiple times. With some brains, a lot of heart, old school stunt work, and an authentic romance, it's some real old-fashioned moviemaking, and a less maudlin look at the industry than Hal Needham's Hooper.

Could've used more bar brawls, though. The nifty action sequences never overpower the amusing interludes (love the aural nod to Lee Majors’ The Six Million Dollar Man) or the disarming performances by Gosling and Blunt. This package is absolutely and undeniably entertaining, offering up action, romance, and a mostly coherent storyline sure to deliver a good time. So, if you enjoy Leitch's work (namely BULLET TRAIN and the quippy HOBBS AND SHAW), you should have a good time here. I probably enjoyed the former more, but THE FALL GUY is probably the most accomplished of the trio. ... it’s fantastic that the film not only lives up to the hype, it exceeds it. With luck, this prequel-like tale is only the first of a few cinematic iterations, because this cast rules and the possibilities of where they can go with this are endless. Utilizing the standard action cliches to great effect, The Fall Guy uses its wonderful cast and extremely silly, over-the-top plot to deliver a highly-entertaining, action-packed love letter to the stunt community. The best parts are where the film borrows from the original series... squarely aimed at Gosling's fanbase... forgiving the constant self-awareness will carry viewers through to the credits on charm alone. With decades of stunt-work to his name, Leitch is in the unique position to present his thoroughly entertaining, albeit a little bit mindless, thesis as to why there desperately needs to be an Oscar category for stunts. It took him a while, but David Leitch finally found the perfect movie for his sensibilities. I doubt it will be his last great crowd-pleaser, as The Fall Guy is a harbinger for things to come. Blunt & Gosling are magnetic with little moments like him tightening her hat's drawstring under her chin, or her asking him to roll down his truck window as he blares Taylor Swift. This is the stuff that lasts long after our popcorn is blown to bits. Blunt imbues the whole thing with enough soul to make Gosling’s willingness to risk life and limb feel like a fair tradeoff. Smartly, Leitch knows what he’s got in Gosling, and the director leans heavily on the Oscar-nominee’s charisma and the chemistry he shares with Blunt, a pure delight with underrated comic chops.  It’s about the unsung heroes of Hollywood and all the work they do to make people want to go to the movies. That alone should give audiences a reason to check this one out, and maybe petition for a Best Stunt Oscar category while they’re at it.


 The action comedy celebrates the skilled men and women behind action movies, who transform actors into cinematic superheroes. Despite occasional pacing issues. It drags itself to the finish line simply on the charisma of its leading couple, who do their level best at making even the cringiest material work. And yet, I still found the bromance in The Nice Guys more affecting. Despite a bloated runtime, The Fall Guy succeeds off the immeasurable charm of the movie’s leads and a loving tribute to stunt crews. Even as we root for the stakes of justice and romance, The Fall Guy insists on relentless humour all the way to end feeling like a balm of genuine good-natured comedy amidst a more serious landscape of 2024 film so far.  Yes, the life of a stunt double may look interesting on screen, but what goes on behind the scenes is like the Keystone Kops. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt -a match made in popcorn heaven- keep this sleek action-comedy charged, until the script runs out of narrative gasoline. [Full Review in Spanish]","A charming, uplifting movie. It was exciting with good cinematography and music. Can't ask for much more. Not what we expected.  Silly. Not sure where the plot was going, but not pulling us in enough to spend time watching so we turned it off after twenty minutes. Thought i'd enjoy it more than i did. Boring. Terrible script. Waste of talent, money and resources. At $5.99 on Amazon Prime I still felt like I got ripped off. It’s not easy to find a place to review somewhat current movies. The Fall Guy 2024 is not worth your time to watch or review. Okay, medium special effects. Plot totally zero. Characters… cute. Connections … zero. Soundtrack…almost endurable.  
Way too long for no plot, no connection, no Love. Where do the mid-connected leads go when so many get killed?  No Idea! 
Weak times three. Boring—I could have written this tired old script this weekend Had no interest in watching but I did and it quickly became movie of the year and my own top 5 ranking #3 for me Highly entertaining. Especially love the soundtrack and the clever writing. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are perfectly cast for their roles and Hannah Waddingham makes a great villain. Exceptionally bad. Choppy editing and cheesy script. The great actors can’t save this dog of a film. Seems to be the first AI written movie. Strictly paint by numbers plot. No surprises.  Having a scene talking about split screen, while doing a split screen...Oh boy...that says it all. Perhaps the definition of Hollywood mediocrity. Entirely predictable story line supplemented with poor writing. Undoubtedly a stellar cast; the same cannot be said for any of other feature of the film. I personally loved this movie. This movie was everything I expected it to be. It was a hilarious action rom com with a decent plot. I think it was a bit too long and some scenes could have been shorted or removed. But I enjoyed it thoroughly, and will be watching it again soon. All in all, it did what I expected it to do, which was to entertain. I really wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't find my footing in the action packed world of The Fall Guy.

In my opinion, Blunt and Gosling had very little chemistry which threw the plot and its characters motivations into question. 

The 'twist' was obvious pretty early on as well.

I will bump up my review a little because the action scenes were really well choreographed and neat. Terrible film. Overly contrived story void of depth. I thought that from beginning to end, the story and the presentation were ridiculous. I have no idea what the point of a film like this is . . . beyond a formula to sell movies with a big name lead. Trite nonsense, terrible acting literally me This movie was a blast, which in 2024 makes it distinct from the overcooked narrative of most 'large' films. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Although a good cast, who gives all they have, David Leitch really did a terrible job with this one.
The trailer is very misleading.  The action scenes are very often really great, but completely ruined by the humor in them that would be good for one or two lines, but not for the most stupid conversations, it just is way to much.
And one has to wait for an hour before the movie really gets some pace. PERFECTION. THAT WILL BE ALL. I was disappointed . The acting and comedy felt forced-not natural.  It was trying to be one of those hip clever comedy action movies but just fell flat. The chemistry between Emily and Ryan just wasn't that great."
Action,mission_impossible_dead_reckoning_part_one,"Blending a good mix of easily identifiable stakes and intricate psychological strategizing that feels like six dimensional chess at times, it is a film with constant momentum and breakneck pacing. The fact that the now 61(!)-year-old Cruise is still willing to push his physical limits to this level for the sake of doing cool stuff on screen is as admirable as it is truly insane. The movies are built around death-defying showcases of suspense and bravado that grow increasingly more mind-boggling with each sequel. Dead Reckoning is a victim of its own high standard. By now, we know how superlative the Mission: Impossible series can be. Anything less feels like a step down, and a step down felt unthinkable until now. The film’s dense, fast-moving cold open harkens back to the franchise’s roots as a Cold War-era spy series. If anything the potential dangers of AI are even more in the news now than when the film was shot, making it feel bang up to date. A fading echo of Hawksian professionalism and humanism... Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie have perfected their formula: cram so much action in that audiences don't care how repetitive the plots have gotten. Tom Cruise runs and jumps and flings himself off of and into things for our enjoyment, as always. Just a big and loud summer blockbuster in all the ways a big and loud summer blockbuster should be. Piecing it all together alternates between big action set-pieces and more suspenseful character-driven standoffs, which gives the film an invigorating rhythm that keeps you glued The action is so extraordinary (and surprisingly, at times, really really funny) throughout this epic, gasp-inducing global adventure that any hesitation to recommend would be a disservice to the spirit of excitement that movies so rarely achieve anymore. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One seemed a bit ambitious with its lengthy run time and a cliffhanger ending. By the time the credits rolled, it’s clear the franchise can go as long as Cruise and McQuarrie want it to at this point. A solid new entry with plenty of astonishing set-pieces.  Dead Reckoning delivers most of everything that series fans could want, though it’s still only half a film. ""Dead Reckoning Part One"" is honestly only as great as it is thanks to each film that came before it. So wherever this film may fall on a series ranking list, it owes all of its successes to the work done previously. It may not have the strongest storyline of the lot, but it serves it well enough, giving you all the thrills we've come to expect from the series. The movie delivers an extraordinary production that has a few minutes worthy of the action movie hall of fame... [Full review in Spanish] Overlong if enjoyably bonkers, there's also an undercurrent of chaos, with bits of key turning up everywhere; at times it felt like there were enough for everyone to have a spare set.  McQuarrie and Cruise deliver thrills that have us sweating in our seats as we vicariously feel – not watch, or sense, but feel – the danger... That’s why we’re here.","Easily the worst MI movie since the second outing. Whilst some suspension of belief is always required to enjoy these spy capers in pursuit of joyous action driven craziness this outing takes matters way too far. 

The plot, if we can call it that, centres around a new adversary, the 'Entity"" which is some kind of AI super villain in the making. It's all a little too preposterous and not in a 'throw a chair with a bomb attached down a lift shaft at Nakatomi Plaza' kind of way. Action movies are often at their best when some brevity is introduced so that the seriousness is dialled down. The MI series has done that well at times but in this one both the story and the characters take second place to stunts (yes they're good though) and OTT portrayals played without a hint of irony. Maybe being filmed during covid didn't help in that regard because some past magic was certainly lost here. It's also rather long and boring. Not a good combo for an action flick. Ethan still a world class sprinter. Terrible script.  Cheesy.  Don't watch with subtitles.  It's basic. This movie made the year 2023 unforgettable Engaging and entertaining plot, can't wait for next part Cool locations but weak plot. The main female was annoying constantly running away. Very unrealistic that a tiny blond could be so tough. Great action, amazing twists and crazy mission impossible. Definitely watching the sequel. This movie as all mission impossible’s are amazing!! It just keeps getting better and better! I was at the edge of my seat the entire time and upset that the next one wasn’t out yet! It is sad though that everyone Ethan gets involved with dies. Is it possible to stop killing his love interest? Cliched, beyond elongated, an amorphous plot and hackneyed “twists,” this was only part one of two.  I will not be watching the sequel. I thoroughly enjoyed all the action, but the dialogue was often so stilted, hackneyed, and portentous as to be silly. Pretty much a waste of time, except for the idea of a rogue AI and its probabilistic way of thinking (e.g. motivating Ethan to kill Gabriel).  The action scenes are done well, but are long and tedious.  The plot is inane.  The main character (Tom Cruise) has no chemistry of any kind. Much better quality than your run of the mill action movie, but still has many of the same boring tired tropes in action movies, ie. the bomb that's defused a second before it's about to go off. I guess it did end up being a fake bomb lol. I'd take MI3 with the much better plot over these later, more glitzy and stylish Mission Impossibles, but with weaker plots that I couldn't distinguish from one another if I tried. Maybe I just hate action movies, but they used to have better plots. This is not only the worst screenplay I've seen in years, but the worst acting as well. It's flat and predictable with an occasional slide into stupidity. Not even Rebecca Fergusons's appearence here can save this. A high-octane adventure featuring one of the more interesting premises in the series. Fantastic stunts and camera work. Solid acting. Cruise is awesome, as always. I'm looking forward to part 2! The very best yet - can't wait for the sequel! I was surprised that with a core plot of something so simple of “ hey guys we need to get two keys” I had no idea it would get so complicated. I would say that the action was fantastic but because of how it was marketed Tom Cruise’s stunts seemed a little less inserting because you knew what was going to happen and how it was going to happen. I did like the details they added. I would have loved if they did more mask stuff because that is always my favorite parts. To be honest I just don’t think it lived up to the expectations and standards of the previous movies. I do still think that I will watch the second part. 
- Jenny What a great film!! Was on the edge of my seat for the duration!!
Can't wait for Part 2 This movie blew me away. It had everything you’d want from an action packed triller: intricate plot, great action scenes, and a sprinkle of comedy to balance it all out. The new characters who were introduced we’re fantastic and really brought it. Tom Cruise was brilliant as always. This was definitely my favorite mission impossible movie. Movie written for kids to follow. Talks you through the whole movie, its like having to replay scense twice. Could watch it with my eyes closed. ooo nice never saw ai in an action movie and not too much fighting. it
really left on a ""cliff"" hanger lol 😆"
Action,deadpool_and_wolverine,"Demand for the movie is high and, although it's not the be-all/end-all of superhero movies, its anarchic and rambunctious approach to the genre results in an entertaining hybrid of comic book action and straightforward satire. With awesome action, heart, humour and a cavalcade of famous faces, Deadpool & Wolverine is the unapologetically fun flick we all need in our lives right now. It is funny and enjoyable - most of the time. For as downtrodden Marvel has been the last few years, a movie like Deadpool & Wolverine feels entirely necessary for the brand. Deadpool & Wolverine is the epitome of a summer blockbuster win. Reynolds and Jackman are comic book perfect in their roles as they balance meta and witty quips, bloody action, and a ton of heart. Deadpool makes jokes to mask his insecurities, and Ryan Reynolds plays Deadpool to mask his. It is an unserious movie, loaded with jokes about movies and jokes about movie cliches, as well as just plain old jokes and slapstick comedy. There is hardly a serious bone in its body, despite the high body count. Deadpool and Wolverine thrives with its gory comedy and regenerative heart, being the Viagra that the MCU needed to give fans another round, since Avengers Endgame. That rapid fire style, along with the way too-meta approach, ultimately prevents Deadpool & Wolverine from working as a stand-alone cinematic experience.  Avengers/X-Men fans who're looking for fun, keep your ears open. The real party is in the freaky chatter. Hall H: The Movie, offering up an onslaught of familiar (though largely forgotten) superhero faces intended to elicit knowing, nostalgic nods and applause. ...a predictably bloated blockbuster... There are times when Deadpool & Wolverine seems to understand the futility of its own fixations. Yet the movie ultimately endorses Deadpool's left-field desire for conformity with tired, oft-stated MCU ideals.  The prime reason “Deadpool & Wolverine” exists is how the movie not only references the MCU and crosses over into “X-Men” territory, but dredges up characters from the pre-MCU Marvel movie roster that some viewers may have forgotten ever happened. The jokes land perfectly, that's a big part of the success, like, talking about the obvious talking about the elephants in the room, all that good stuff, I feel like makes the movie so much more enjoyable.   I’m not entirely immune to the charms of this approach; there’s one casting choice, in particular, that made me smile, almost in spite of myself. It’s not enough to make the movie feel like less of a self-cannibalizing slog. The first R-rated film in the MCU owned by Disney is a Supercalifragilisticexplicitalidocious spectacle! Arriving in the nick of time to breathe new life into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A viciously violent and proudly profane buddy action comedy that will especially play well with MCU devotees. DEADPOOL AND WOLVERINE is a full-blown comedy disguised as a messy and often inappropriately violent action film. But for those who have been waiting years for something like this, it’s an absolute blast. It is what it is exactly as promised. Is it the best we've seen Deadpool? No. Is it the best we've seen Wolverine? Absolutely not. Avengers this is not - but is it fun? Sure, just not as amazing as fanboys might have you think.","All I can say is wow! And not in a good way This is honestly the best movie I have seen in a while. It has a great soundtrack (I especially loved the NSYNC opening credits) and amazing comedy. I would definitely recommend it, even if you are not a fan of Marvel movies! 1000% fan service!!! It is about time Marvel listens to their fan base. The cameos were great and seeing both Wolverine and Deadpool on screen together was awesome!!! The story was good and entertaining. I’ve already watched it twice. Maximum Effort was put into this movie. Absolute comedy gold. Great action and special effects. Will actually be back for a second viewing, rare for me. Can't wait. The best movie of 2024👍🏻👍🏻 There was not a bad post to this movie at all. I got emotional seeing Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine with the suit he was born to wear and the cowl destined to only be dawned by Him. I seen this with my mom and I couldnt have been ever so grateful to watch it with her. I grew up watching Hugh Jackmans Wolverine the one and only Wolverine. I would go see this movie again and again. Hugh Jackman is the absolute greatest Marvel actor and Ryan Reynoldss outstanding effort for this film is nothing but inspiring these are two people who are best of friends in life and work and you see that translate into the screen. When I seen the two masks in the table at the end of the film my DREAM became a REALITY!!!! THANK YOU HUGH JACKMAN AND THANK YOU RYAN REYONALDS DEADPOOL AND WOLVERINE Absolutely wonderful!! The movie is nonstop from when you start to when it ends. Love the cameos from the different super hero movies.   Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman went above and beyond to make this a great movie that we all have been waiting for. And kudos to Hugh Jackman for pumping it up and definitely portraying wolverine physique at its finest.!! Amazing, Cameos were incredible, a must see. Pure cinematic redemption! Obsolete cinema. The amount of fan service this film has makes up for the lack of marvel films this year and there other terrible films ""This just feels right!"" Says Wade Wilson during this movie. He's talking about another character while saying that but it is the case with Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU too. Laugh out loud moments by the bucket load. Opening scene was superb and it carried in from there. Loads of ""did he just say what I thought he did"" one liners . Looking forward to watching again to pick up more of those one liners that I'm sure I missed while laughing ! I loved it. I loved both Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. They were hilarious together. Special effects were great. I was interested throughout the whole movie. Love that. This is the Wolverine everyone who grew up reading the comics have been waiting for. Deadpool and Wolverine dialogue is brilliant. Ive waiting years to finally see Deadpool and Wolverine in the same movie, must see if youre a Deadpool fan! great movie definitely watch again Ryan Reynolds has such great comedic timing, Deadpool will always be one of my favorite characters.  Add Hugh Jackman to the mix and the movie is bound to be good!  It did not disappoint!  I felt like I could watch it all over again as soon as it ended.  MUST SEE!!! It was very entertaining and non-stop action and comedy. You did not really have to know much about past movies to understand exactly what was going on in this movie. And the moral story at the very end was the icing on the cake. Keep up the good work. Good movie! Not for the sensitive. Had lots of action, violence and language. My grandson loved it but as for me it wasn't what I expected. It was a comedy with heros. Excellent for young adults. This was one of the best marvel movies ever made. A wonderful mix between fox and disney!"
