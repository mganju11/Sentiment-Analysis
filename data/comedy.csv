Comedy,wonka,"It‚Äôs the sweet treat that I didn‚Äôt know I wanted, but now that I‚Äôve tasted it, I‚Äôm hooked. For a movie whose necessity was initially questionable, King and his team have once again shown that they shouldn‚Äôt be underestimated. For decades, children around the world have loved Willy Wonka. And it makes perfect sense; who wouldn't want to worship someone who peddles exclusively in making candy? Chalamet tends to play more serious parts: young cannibal in love, legendary British king, meth addict. ‚ÄúWonka‚Äù allows him to show off another side of his talent, scoring the golden ticket and a Golden Globe nomination.  Wonka serves just enough of its own brand of singing, dancing, chocolate-coated sweetness to effectively tell its story of a mildly eccentric candymaker with mommy issues taking on the corrupt bureaucracy of a city that runs on a candy economy. WONKA is a delicious and delightful confection from start to finish. Full of music, wonder, and questioning of the social order, it doesn‚Äôt preach so much that it forgets to entertain.  Paul King delivers yet another whimsical and innocent family fun tale. Chalamet is also quite funny as the wacky chocolate maker. A sappy, unkempt and woefully incongruous origin story of Roald Dahl's villainous chocolatier, Wonka's strained sentimentality is fueled by empty calories.  It had all the ingredients to be a truly eccentric and cloying disaster... and yet, it ended up becoming one of the most magical and wonderful films of 2023. Yes, Wonka is a prequel, and it's also an origin story, and it's fresh, imaginative, and fun.  Wonka is a complete innocent, a really nice kid ‚Ä¶ and a bit of a dullard. There‚Äôs no method to his madness as seen in the ‚Äô71 flick -- in fact, there‚Äôs no madness at all, and it‚Äôs difficult to see this guileless lad transform into Wilder's warped genius. The film is ultimately a mixed bag thanks to its somewhat-simplistic & by-the-numbers storyline that doesn't really have any compelling or surprising directions it can go. Irritatingly free of the ""pure imagination"" that it presumes to be its most sacred value. A tasteless and unfunny prequel that, like poisoned candy, never finds the appropriate rhythm to burn the calories of its supposed spectacle of music, chocolate and fantasy. [Full review in Spanish] Wonka is an imperfect but kind of lovely little treat... Though the film doesn't quite hang together and features some odd choices (fat suits?!), this secret musical is still a crowd-pleaser. There‚Äôs some joy to be had here ‚Äì and there are worse ways to pass your time... A delightfully magical tale featuring a wonderful and tender performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet. It expands the Willy Wonka mythology in some fun, vibrant and musical ways under the beautiful, light and touching direction from Paul King. A genuine treat! Wonka sits comfortably as a double feature to its 1971 predecessor. While it is lighter on themes of capitalism and other social commentary it remains centred in emotional resonance with the world and characters. Wonka, the prequel, surprised me pleasantly. While it can't match the Gene Wilder classic, it stands on its own with solid storytelling and acting.","Just wasn't for me. The songs sounded mediocre. The casting? Average. I am not a big fan of a ton of computer graphics, which this movie had. Of course we are not comparing this with the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but if you do compare, this was disappointing. I can‚Äôt for the life of me understand why people don‚Äôt like it. It was whimsical and magical and had some pretty catchy musical numbers. Timoth√©e Chalamet was a perfect casting (in my opinion) and they did a great job giving each character a purpose and a background. I also liked the addition of the villains as they added some extra drama and suspense to the story. Nothing will ever compare to the original, but I think this did a great job of trying to recapture the magic. It doesn't stink, it reeks. Very heartwarming! ‚ù§Ô∏è The songs were terrible, nothing has been able to capture the masterpiece that was the original. This movie had a few elements that were neat but overall terrible Loved this movie, great for kids and adults too. I don‚Äôt recommend it. The film was very boring and predictable. I was gonna 5 star this, but when I saw an officer try to kill Wonka, I gave it 1 star because him trying to drown Wonka reminds me of my dad and grandpa fighting and screaming in Wii Sports boxing! üòÇüòÇüòÇ Dude this movie is SO bad, I‚Äôm shook ! Why was this made ? Mostly importantly, HOW does it have so many good reviews ???? Am I missing something ? Literally one of the worst movies of the year. I loved every second of it. This movie is very good but you can't beat the original. 8.3/10. if i were not take the flight ,and  i do not have to much things to watch, i am not going to make myself suffer one hour and half. I had no interest in seeing this when it crossed my awareness initially.
Having viewed the original and this in the same weekend, with my offspring, I have nothing but praise.
For me, this hit the emotive spark. It gave me the nostalgic connection to the original, and had me oscillating between sobbing and laughter.
For something I would have disregarded, pleasantly surprised to have experienced such sensations again. I truly hope that team is proud of what they‚Äôve created.
I might never recover from the hysterics of seeing Hugh in that form, and I‚Äôm delighted by that.
Timothee committed to the character, and the delivery was beautiful; as was his voice. 
I went from skepticism to transportation. Which has to be the best outcome, for me.
The singular lines tying those timelines together, and the way the debt was repaid‚Ä¶magic. A thousand fold. The movie is really not good.  It has a few parts that are decent and not terrible, but overall, it is pretty bad and I can not recommend it to anyone.  The noodle character is very poorly done. I don't know if it is the actor or the director, but the noodle character is terrible. Entertaining, but not as delectable as I hoped it would be. It's everything a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory prequel should be, but it's missing the unhinged light in Wonka's eye, and as such it feels like there is a third story  in-between we are still missing. You could see a lot of what was coming long before it came, but that doesn't mean we didn't enjoy watching the cast dance and sing their way through another catchy musical number on the way. Easily forgettable songs and story make me mourn to the days when writers actually had talent and entertainment executives had taste. Timoth√©e Chalamet did a fantastic job playing Wonka. Tough shoes to fill but he pulls it off. The story will keep you interested and wanting to follow to the end. Acting other than Wonka is average at best. Great songs. visually stunning The only thing that would have made it better is if it wasn‚Äôt a musical. Great movie though. Magical chocolate.üòç A total waste of the source material and acting talent.  Good actors hamming it up like their careers depended on it gets old after 5 minutes, script is puerile, and not in a good way, visual style is last century Harry Potter ... avoid."
Comedy,trolls_band_together,"Family is a recurring theme in the Trolls series of animated films and Trolls Band Together gives you a double dose of such adventures. Trolls Band Together is pretty much just like the other Trollses. It‚Äôs a perfectly acceptable 90 minutes of middling entertainment... This animated fever dream does serve as the prefect excuse for NSYNC to reunite. This third installment is more clever and funny than you would expect and actually soars musically.  Its villains could‚Äôve been more fleshed-out, but they‚Äôre more comically entertaining than the previous antagonists in Trolls World Tour. Despite uninspired vocal turns from Rannells and Schumer, the Milli Vanilli-inspired framing device saves their arc... ... a meaningful story is mostly pushed aside to create opportunities to utilize song after song, as well as a reunion for one of the biggest boy bands of the late ‚Äò90s and early ‚Äò00s, ultimately creating a cotton candy confection of an experience ... Like the first two films Kendrick and Timberlake return to voice our favorite trolls, and they do so with great inflection and tonal quality. Good music, good animation, good fun for the entire family. Fans will love the music, but the story falls short, and the character-growth is lackluster. ‚Ä¶unlike Barbie, there‚Äôs no take on the material at all here, it‚Äôs just an advert for a brand of dolls, a ‚Äòjoy bomb‚Äô that resolutely fails to explode‚Ä¶ A passable, middling candy-coloured time killer, though it moves so fast it doesn‚Äôt allow much time to get involved with the characters or engage with the story. It‚Äôs like an iridescent blur set to pop songs. This is the third installment of the Trolls franchise, so it's not surprising that it has all the individuality and inspiration of a Big Mac.  Trolls Band Together has enough of the right stuff to keep the target audience and their kids entertained. It‚Äôs a veritable feast of boy band-related gags, many of which are hilarious. This movie is a disjointed piece of non-stop stimuli. It‚Äôs an attack on the senses where the set pieces blend into each other. It genuinely feels like an acid trip at times. DreamWorks Animation will keep churning them out, but Trolls Band Together would be a perfect place to end this mildly successful fun run of splashy color, slick music, and wacky energy. I will give Trolls Band Together this much: it is the first film in the series that did not give me a headache. At a mile-a-minute, Trolls Band Together rarely allows a moment to catch your breath, but when it‚Äôs having so much fun, I don‚Äôt really think anyone will complain. The whole movie feels a bit like a laboratory for playing with new examples of the series' defined aesthetic. it‚Äôs all fun, with enjoyable tunes new and old, and some very impressive animation as well.  The sibling focus means that younger viewers will get to see Branch humorously (and movingly) interact with his big brothers (who still see him as a baby), which adds depth to his behavior in the first movie. ","music/dance for my 4 year old grand girl who loves music and dance-she was glued to it! All of these movies are made when the cast and crew are high, I'm convinced. This movie was not appropriate for kids, weird characters and includes scenes relating sex, drugs, and other confusing topics that will not be okay for little kids to watch. Definitely an adults movie, not PG. I didnt like the swearing or sexual innuendos. This is supposed to be for kids! It also seemed like the people who made this movie were on some serious drugs I don't deserve this! Why is this happening to me üò≠ I enjoyed the first film and thought this one would be a good continuation of the story. After a short time I thought I would check this site and was surprised to see saw the audience review was so high. It is missing something that I can't describe but it wasn't enjoyable at all. I am a huge fan of Dreamworks films, especially the Trolls series, but even so some of the stuff in this film just didn‚Äôt do it for me. The songs were good, and so was the animation and characters, but the plot felt a little scattered? Without spoiling too much, it tried too hard to make you feel attached to these characters we‚Äôve heard nothing about and then barely learn anything about, focusing a lot more on the villains (which in my opinion isn‚Äôt bad). One of the characters is just Poppy but slightly altered with personality and i didn‚Äôt like that. However they did expand on world building quite a bit and that‚Äôs always what i love to see out of any Dreamworks universe, so i quite enjoyed that. The songs, the songs, THE SOOOOOONGSüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üíØ. Ey this movie got me feeling like starting a boy band myself! good songs. good movie The Movie After Trolls 1 & 2, Also There's Camila Cabello, Troye Sivan, Eric Andre, Daveed Diggs, And Kid Cudi), also there's the best Villain, and Best Original Song (Better Place) Yeah it‚Äôs predictable, but it doesn‚Äôt pretend not to be! It‚Äôs certainly the best out of the three installments, with laugh-out-loud moments for kids and adults (seriously though, watch your kids‚Äô ears lol). The plot was interesting enough, characters were sweet to watch, and I was jamming along the whole time. Trolls: Band Together is an okay movie with some nice music that kids will enjoy, but the only things that make it worthwhile are its colorful animation and its good performances from it talented actors. love the characters love the villains and love the story I believe this is the worst animated movies I‚Äôve ever seen very entertaining  and fast past for people with small attention span this has had to be the best trolls movie ever
I love how this time round, branch is the main character for once. There were a couple of emotional scenes that literally made me tear up and that's quite surprising coming from a trolls movie. The songs and performances were mostly all really good and really intrigued me especially ""Better Place, Family reunion"" it was literally the best I wish I could watch them perform it out ( trolls ver.) shout-out to Justin Timberlake for another amazing song.
However, despite my love for the storyline and songs, I have to say, the addition of viva ( poppy's sister) was rather extra and annoying, her personality was loud and just quite irratating to me. It was just a sudden random addition to the show, it would have been much better if she was just a random troll they met on the way instead of actually being part of the ""family""

People thinking trolls is just a nonsensical noisy movie are just frankly too old for it. Don't watch something that's not to your liking and give bad ratings because of it. I do like the songs but the movie plot was bad, because it only showed Branch‚Äôs family reunion and it just sucked. I hope the fourth installment is better. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. The kid loved it, the wife loved it and I have no problem with replaying it again. After seeing this movie I am now a troll Best Trolls movie full of heart felt moments. This movie replaces all the old annoying characters like smidge and biggie with new interesting characters with depth. The soundtrack is amazing possibly Best soundtrack of a dreamworks movie."
Comedy,wish_2023,"Wish is a decent film with good themes to share, although it somewhat buckles under the weight of its status. ...would be instantly forgettable if it weren‚Äôt for the bizarre story choices that can only be described as autopopulated hiccups. A grab bag of storytelling tropes, generic characters and musical styles from the well-thumbed Disney playbook. A musical mashup of irksome ideas... a lifeless husk dressed up like a feature film. Every decision seems to stop at the first idea... never plussed in any way or given any complexity... exists merely because the studio demanded it. Competent but boring, typically Disneyesque yet unenthused and forgettable. Disney 100 turns up a catch-22: Those who have seen many Disney movies are the target audience of Wish, but those who have seen many Disney movies have already seen everything in this movie. While it doesn't have catchy songs or a sound plot like Encanto, Wish still manages to bring the public a simplicity and candor that we haven't seen in a long time. [Full review in Spanish] Wish could have been another Disney triumph, limited only by time to fully realize its grand vision. With imagination as its flag, Wish paradoxically chooses to honor Disney's history in the most linear and conservative way possible, appealing to the emotion of a loyal audience over the risk of starting a more disruptive path... [Full review in Spanish] A musical film, tied to many of the tips, clich√©s, or whatever you want to call what usually populates these types of films, that's clearly aimed at the little ones. [Full review in Spanish] There is nothing too irritating but also nothing surprising in Chris Buck's film... [Full review in Spanish] Wish feels soulless at times, but the film is a step in the right direction for Disney Animation Studios, as the company acknowledges they have fresh characters, not merely sequels, even if the characters retread classic storylines.  When you remind audiences of classic movies they grew up with, even as an Easter egg, it takes away from what‚Äôs being played in front of them. You‚Äôd rather watch the reference. And that‚Äôs the biggest problem. The film has no identity of its own.
 On one level, the total artistic failure of Wish is reassuring because it shows there are occasions when vast amounts of money and supposed expertise really don‚Äôt make a difference. A lukewarm homage that lacks Disney's visual and narrative inventiveness. [Full Review in Spanish] ‚ÄúWish‚Äù is a perfectly enjoyable, entertaining fairy tale. It is an expressive nod to the past, paying tribute to Disney‚Äôs extensive legacy in animation.  [Wish] assumes that the magic that governs its universe is will save it and turn it into a remembered tribute, but it only ends up being a fairly executed project with beautiful and wasted art. [Full review in Spanish] In knowing what the studio is capable of, and in banking so much on this film‚Äôs relation to the centennial, we can‚Äôt help but wish for something a little more impactful Though Wish contains none of the identity politics that have soured other Disney flops (Strange World; Lightyear; Elemental), its main snag is just how abstract and drab the premise is...If Disney creatives can‚Äôt do better than this, Heaven help them. While this isn‚Äôt the most essential big-screen cartoon you‚Äôll ever see, there is plenty of good stuff happening on a regular basis. Particularly whenever the multi-talented DeBose gets to sing, or Pine gets to indulge in some kooky villainy.","I love it! My daughter also loves it. We listen to the album and at least watch it once a week. O find the songs catchy and the message it conveys is also so wholesome. This was another wonderful Disney animated movie with some catchy new original songs. It had a similar feel to Encanto, which I don‚Äôt mind cause I loved that movie as well. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll make a profit (it costed 200 million) but it will be another hit on Disney+. 'Wish' lacks oomph with its story, but I found the soundtrack to be pleasing.

I think I literally liked every song, which is impressive. I wouldn't say any of them are pieces of music that I'd listen to on their own, at least not religiously or anything close, but connected with the movie onscreen the music is very fitting. ""This Wish"" and ""At All Costs"" are probably the standouts.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the plot. It's all suitably interesting and held my attention span from beginning to end, but there's just something missing - I can't quite put my finger on what - that stops this 2023 film from being anything above 'good' in my opinion.

The cast, like the music, are a positive. Chris Pine is very good, while Ariana DeBose leads more than competently; I've seen DeBose in a few flicks now and I do like her. Only post-watch am I learning that this was apparently billed as some sort of 100 year special for Disney as a company. How bizarre! Desejos verdadeiros tem grande poder no mundo, quanto mais sincero, mais poderoso e realiz√°vel porque eles emanam vibra√ß√µes, que os fazem acontecer‚Ä¶ J√° me apaixonei pela trilha sonora em portugu√™s... O roteiro √© bonitinho, v√°lido, personagens cativantes, extremamente musical (fofinho para as crian√ßas, entediante para os altinhos), e a maior raz√£o disso √© que este celebra os 100 anos Disney,  os produtores disseram que fizeram mais de 100 men√ß√µes aos cl√°ssicos, uma grande homenagem, nem percebi. Magnifico did nothing wrong.

Goat was unbearable.

Asha is a terrible character.

Animation looks so flat and unfinished?? I can't explain it. Similar color palette to Encanto but so bland and lifeless. 

Disney had to put out ""A Movie"" and I guess this was indeed A Movie ü§∑ *shrug* Worst Disney/Pixar movie. Boring storyline. Would not recommend This movie is bad. The animation is weird and doesn‚Äôt really look nice, the music was forgettable, and the plot was awful. If your wish can‚Äôt be granted because it‚Äôs too dangerous, then it cant be granted because it‚Äôs too dangerous. Just shut up and deal with it, Asha. ‚ÄúThis Wish‚Äù is a good song but other than that the music falls pretty flat. The supporting characters are very forgettable and Asha is only moderately interesting. A miss for Disney. Just Watch Moana 2 and wait for release Me encant√≥ la pel√≠cula, entiendo porque a muchos no les gust√≥ pero hay que tomar en cuenta que es un homenaje al trabajo antiguo del estudio, no busca ser una historia novedosa y moderna. La historia no es incre√≠ble pero si es buena. Hay alguno que otro punto qu√© queda un poco raro, y sobretodo algunos personajes poco memorables. Como dije esto es un gran homenaje al trabajo del estudio y sobre todo a los cuentos cl√°sicos de disney! Protagonist with a flat and irritating personality, forgettable songs, useless characters, dull villain. The film only lives off the references to Disney's Good films from YEARS ago. Not to mention the script and shameful lines and plot holes.
And the animation is rubbish, 2d animation deserves respect, that's what Disney lived and made its name from. This studio lost its magic a long time ago Me encanta la magia que tiene esta pel√≠cula, celebrando los 100 a√±os del estudio ""Walt Disney Animation Studios"" The animation style looks lazy and the background is not paid much attention. I'm not an animator but I'd say that the quality of this movie compared to other disney movie is not that good. The songs are not catchy as they say and they're actually right, It's just okay but not going to recommend this to my friends. :) I just watched this on Disney+ and I still want my money back. For the first time in my life I agree with the critics on this, this movie is awful. It‚Äôs lazy, inorganic, and couldn‚Äôt possibly be the culmination of 100 years. The songs weren‚Äôt catchy, the lyrics are lazy, the voice acting doesn‚Äôt sound right, the background animation is lazy, and the plot is terrible. Those of you saying it‚Äôs good, just want it to be good, but it‚Äôs not and if you stopped wanting Disney to be what it was you‚Äôd see that. Just missed the quality for these 100 years Hot take, this is a kids movie people. And the kids really seem to love it. The movie kept their attention, the storyline was simple and they could understand the major plot points. They really loved the star character and the magic scenes. The animation was just fine and reminded me of classic disney. For me, the music easily makes up for the ""creative shortcomings"". We listen to soundtrack all the time. Stop overthinking the quality of a child's movie and try to remember what made your eyes light up when you were a kid. I really liked this movie,Why? Because it was a great tribute to the 100 years of Disney,I absolutely loved it,I know people are like oh this is so bad blah blah blah but if they watch it they can see it‚Äôs a great movie, it pays tribute to the hundred years of Disney and the end credits are amazing because at the end they tribute all the movies in order [not trying to spoil] and the Easter eggs in it are 100% Yeah this Movie Not Good, Just Better than Disney's Moana, And Before Moana 2 Come Out Worst Disney film ever It‚Äôs uncontrollably fast-paced and had a hugely confusing plot, but this celebration that Disney has given itself is dazzlingly animated, beautifully sung, and filled with much nostalgia, even if there are way too many songs to keep track of."
Comedy,saltburn,"While its debaucherous presentation of lavish lifestyles may prove a bit much or strange for certain audiences, its strengths lie in its performances, assertive craftsmanship, and its critical, if perhaps somewhat muddy, themes on avarice.  A delicious sort of contradiction in Saltburn sets the tone for the entire film. A carefully-constructed masterpiece... The film doesn‚Äôt really say anything new about the rich, or the social climbers who imitate them, but it‚Äôs plenty entertaining even as it veers into borderline camp territory in the final twenty minutes.  Saltburn isn‚Äôt going to leave you feeling warm and fuzzy, but sometimes, I prefer to feel horrified and giggling to avoid my own discomfort. Buckle up for some fun. Barry Keoghan steals the scenes. Keoghan plays a doe-eyed sociopath, obsessed, dark, and aloof, with such grounded insanity that it brings to mind his earlier roles in The Green Knight and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. It‚Äôs impossible not to sense the film completely slipping from her once the narrative begins unveiling a bold set of reveals in this final third. It‚Äôs Gothic stateliness by way of Goth subculture -- enter at your own risk. These liaisons aren't nearly dangerous enough in Emerald Fennell's initially interesting but ultimately feckless exercise in the depravity of class issues and the polite homophobia of the mid-2000s.  Writer/director Emerald Fennell helps usher in 2023 as the year that Cinema vaulted back to life, with a transgressive black comedy that splashes cum-soaked mud on corporate cinema with tireless glee.

Comic book movies be damned. You don‚Äôt get to feed us nonsense and then expect us to thank you when you try to explain it. Derivative it may be ‚Äì the plot is a salad of ideas pinched from Evelyn Waugh, Patricia Highsmith and Pasolini ‚Äì you won‚Äôt be bored for a second. It was impossible to shake the comparison to Ripley with Saltburn while I was watching it, but I still tried to revel in Fennell‚Äôs audaciousness, coupled with a truly game and committed performance from Keoghan. Exasperatingly toxic psycho sexual drama - that varies between bizarre and disgusting A weird, intense movie that has the courage of its convictions. Barry Keoghan gives a brilliant performance as the complicated, many-sided Oliver Quick, ably supported by the rest of this talented cast. Writer-director Emerald Fennell creates a wicked study of social classes with some surprising plot twists.  Saltburn sparked discussion, but for all its stylized images and clever gendered trope inversions, its queer promises are empty. A great time produced by a great director without being a great movie. Saltburn is a brilliant movie that is almost brought down by a poorly written ending. Saltburn is pretty and plenty of its audience will delight in being able to say they were in on the joke whenever the film resurfaces on social media. A viral movie is not necessarily a good movie.","I loved this movie and would recommend a watch. There are some shocking moments that are unexpected, pushing the boundaries. Barry playing Oliver is so fabulous. He always plays that creepy role so well but my fav character was the Elspeth, I think Rosamund did a brilliant job in her performance. I have debated with friends on whether it was necessary to have an ending that goes back an explains what happened. For me I think it was fine as is so I give 5 stars. A cinematic masterpiece. I advice you to dive deeper into the foreshadowing throughout the film‚Ä¶ you will not be disappointed! An interesting film - one comment that I thought would describe it accurately in describing the film would be ""The Great Gatsby meets Richard Wagner"".  Jaw dropping at times and tender at others.  Greed and avarice seem to be common themes. Cinematic art. 
Emotional rollercoaster of going from mysterious and sexy, to uncomfortable and unhinged. 
Should come with a warning This film felt like a sick and twisted reimagining of the Great Gatsby. I was intrigued and appaled only to be intrigued once again. It was an unexpected ride and by the end I kind of wanted to take it for another spin. This film surprised me by how much I ended up liking it. If you can tolerate some very obscure, obscene and even disgusting scenes, in a few parts, this will be an enjoyable albeit bizarre encounter for you. Although I had my doubts in the end I didn't regret it one bit. Stop watching half way through because i so disgusted by it, but after continue it i even more disgusted by it and amaze it at the same time i didn't expect how's this movie gonna end. It's just blow my mind and they just left me shock in there. Apart from the photography and soundtrack, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, 2 hours of pure nothingness and emptiness. By the end of the film, I was questioning how I managed to torture myself for so long. It will never make sense to me how someone could like this movie just because in the final seconds, the protagonist is revealed to be a sadistic borderline. Throughout the rest of the hours, it's just a disgusting and boring show. This film is visually and emotionally striking. I found myself more intrigued with the production aspects of the film rather than the story itself, though. It's worth a second watch. Solid acting, but the plot was unbelievable and the film got extremely weird at times. Pretentious director whose only goal is to shock you with disturbing sexual content. It‚Äôs like gore only for the sake of gore.. Unfortunately she completely sacrificed the immersion of the film because of it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend unless you simply just want to be disgusted. Movies typically are for entertainment and to try and entertain people with such depravity is a disservice to the art. Other than that it‚Äôs not much. Great cinematography and colour grade though. Emerald Fennell is a hack. Watched on a plane. Wished it had come out in less close proximity to ""Ripley"", since it felt rather derivative. Well-acted. Want to see more of Barry Keoghan's work. A character with ASPD falls in love. It doesn't end well for his love object. Weird, disgusting. Plot was not believable at all. He killed everyone and he was never investigated or doubted. Such a movie! Wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone. So glad I didn't pay for it. Boo. Hiss. Intense, beautiful, thrilling. Only demerit would be the final monologue, it made Barry's character a bit unbelievable. Still laughing, what‚Äôs great movie. J'ai l'impression que c'est une tentative de reproduire Parasite. Tentative √©chou√©e. Je n'ai ressenti qu'un profond malaise face √† un film qui ne propose que du vide et de l'obsc√®ne durant 2h. Le ""plot twist"" √©tait pr√©visible √† des km √† l'avance, laissant un go√ªt de d√©j√† vu vis √† vis de Parasite. Mais contrairement √† ce film, Saltburn n'a pas vraiment r√©ussi √† √©tablir un suspens ni √† porter un quelconque caract√®re critique. Ce film est tout simplement vide. Saltburn looks fantastic and dreamy but this is ultimately a piece of hokum which lacks plausibility and conviction. It feels as if three writing teams were each given a segment and told not to talk to each other. Like a lot of films about the rich it doesn't really have much to say about them other than they are all loafing morons who eat and party all day. A much stronger story would have played this as a story of infatuation and envy but instead the writers go for what they consider to be shocking and forego the plot in the search for jumbling a lot of moments in the hope they stick together. It's a narrative mess by the end and a real disappointment. Na this one was too weird and also disgusting at some parts. Not sure why people would like this movie. Oliver was twisted to a point where I just wanted to punch him in the face the whole movie!"
Comedy,the_holdovers,"In a time when things often seem so hopeless, when the same forces of inequality and military injustices plague our own world, perhaps it‚Äôs this film‚Äôs realistic salve that makes it resonate so strongly.
 Despite the anxiety and even sadness its story exudes, it‚Äôs a movie so in love with its characters, and so steadfast in its humanist convictions, that it reaches into your soul and melts even the most frozen of hearts. The Sideways actor-director duo combine once again for a terrific, bittersweet rumination on life, love and grief. Giamatti and Payne are a movie match made in heaven Payne crafts a movie about the human condition and the loveliness and messiness that goes with it. The Holdovers is a more challenging movie than it might appear on the surface. Unfortunately, The Holdovers really lives up to its name. ... Worth seeing for its playful homage to a very specific slice of cinema history, for its three lead performances, and for a few very good scenes that come before those last, long 30 minutes. Randolph takes the pain and the imminent grief that her character is feeling to the core, making her chain-smoking adaptation to the situation, while watching the game shows and interacting with the other characters all the more impactful. Absolutely nothing new happens in Alexander Payne‚Äôs surprisingly warm and fuzzy film, but it‚Äôs a perfectly fine way to while away 135 minutes. And ‚Äî who knows? ‚Äî you might even remember some well-worn yet valuable life lessons. Anchored by Giamatti‚Äôs compelling central performance ..., The Holdovers takes a meaningful dive into a complex world of emotional conflict ""The Holdovers"" should become a holiday movie classic for audiences to return to every Thanksgiving to keep some perspective on human nature, hypocrisy, and the importance of having a warm heart and a calm mind. A small-scale gem that, by utilizing a 1970s setting, manages to recall the intimate cinema of that period. Giamatti‚Äôs performance is a pleasure to watch. He is the presiding presence in the movie, and David Hemingson‚Äôs erudite screenplay allows him free range to deliver long lines of invective.  It's the beautifully-written characters and the actors that inhabit them that will surely receive the most plaudits A new American classic.  In a film that manages to be touching and consistently funny, you won‚Äôt be surprised to learn that a rapport develops between existentially miserable Paul, who seeks solace in Jim Beam and Marcus Aurelius, and prickly, troublesome Angus. Giamatti doesn‚Äôt let Paul‚Äôs character tics, which include a prominent lazy eye, to distract from the more subtle aspects of his performance. The film is a throwback to the soul-stirring narratives of 70s movies. There‚Äôs a lot of attention to detail as it immerses the audience in a time of societal shifts and cultural upheaval. The three leads work well together and you will root for them, although there is a predictability and heavy-handedness to the story that makes it less moving than it would otherwise be. The warmth with which Payne shows the humanity in his characters helps each one of them unfold into a real, complex person.","I'm thinking it's me,  I love the idea but for me it's messy lead up to a messed up crux. Partly editing but a basic inability to grab, hold and sustain a script that doesn't exist. I want to give kind heartening words but they stuffed up it's intrinsicness. Like stepping up to bat and the game being called off. This movie was great. A great plot with top notch acting from Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da‚ÄôVine Joy Randolph. I just hope there‚Äôs no sequel or spinoff. This was a good one and done for me and I‚Äôd hate to see it get ruined. The Holdovers is a leisurely paced movie that effortlessly blends humor, character development, and heart. Paul Giammati has always been a very versatile actor and should have won an oscar for delivering a masterclass performance in this movie as a Professor trapped in a shell of cynicism and grief, trying to survive and supervise a handful of students.

A movie that depicts an unexpected journey of growth and connection. 
The film excels in its character-driven narrative, avoiding a predictable plot to explore the complexities of human emotion. A testament to the power of unexpected friendships and the healing potential of shared experiences.

A heartwarming and thought-provoking film that will linger and serve as a reminder that even the most hardened hearts can find redemption and joy in unexpected places and people. An all around great slice of life story that brought me to a place of nostalgia for an era I didn‚Äôt even live through. Great acting by all and the cinematography summoned that nostalgia and immerses you in the world of that era. OMG yes - I almost skipped this one, but just kept hanging in. The 70's imagery and cold weather put me back in the days when heating wasn't so good... and the movie had a really good, strong impact. Una bella pel√≠cula sobre perdedores, sobre abandonados, casi sobre olvidados, con todo el esp√≠ritu navide√±o, aunque su ritmo lento y pasivo hace que se sienta larga. Provavelmente por j√° ter lecionado, filmes que retratam professores apaixonados por sua profiss√£o e alunos problem√°ticos sempre me arrancam l√°grimas e me deixam com o cora√ß√£o quentinho... A trilha sonora por si s√≥ j√° nos leva as l√°grimas‚Ä¶ Adorei o humor acido e afiado, e apesar da firmeza e aparente frieza do professor, temos um homem com um grande cora√ß√£o e muito amor... A toxidade paterna expl√≠cita e abandono parental... Deliciosamente sereno de degustar... Well done with some great acting & screen writing Typical maudlin U.S. cheese. This is my FAVORITE SURPRISE MOVIE of the year. Fabulous. It was so unnecessarily long and boring. Paul Giamatti is one of my favorite actors, but he couldn't make this bearable. It was so stale and boring. Great to watch if you want to fall asleep This film clinched my love for Paul Giamatti. DaVine‚Äôs performance was flawless. I gave it 30 minutes, and it did nothing to make me want to keep watching it . Paul Giamatti is one of my fav actors, but even he couldn't make this batch of uncharismatic kids watchable. 

Paul's character's dialogue is the one thing that kept me engaged and watching for the 30 minutes. Maybe this movie turned it around and is excellent in the 2nd and 3rd acts, but i couldn't see this movie surprising me with anything i hadn't already predicted. Great movie, the kind they rarely make anymore. We go from dislike to sympathizing to admiration even, so naturally, for both main characters. Its very much a movie about Kids seeing the faults and humanity in their surrounding adults, as the adults learn to respect the hardship of being a kid/teen who cannot yet control their destiny, but must build their character instead. 
Had a lovely time watching it, all actors did a great job. Sessa really held his own with the giant gift to film that is Pal Giamatti. not an easy feat. Pretty much enjoyed every minute, it was a delight I regret wasting my time on this movie. The characters are dull and uninteresting, and the plot is predictable. Compared to this movie, Good Will Hunting is a masterpiece). Alexander Payne is one of the best film makers going around and this is one of his finest. Great cast and wonderful storytelling. Highly recommend. Just finished watching this on Amazon prime. 10 out of 10. Perfectly cast. Perfectly edited. Wonderful story. The acting? Impeccable, every single character, again perfectly cast. A bit too long at 2H 13 minutes, but great acting and a very touching ""slice of life"" movie. 

I had a great curmudgeon English teacher in High School.  I think he would have sliced out 15 to 30 minutes with red ink.  What grade would he have given?  Probably a B. ""Stand up for the Lady, you Royal Bore!"" I could listen to the dialogue and thoughtful conversation from 1970 all the time. After learning that these Characters and events were based on the writers' memories as children wandering with their uncle, this movie became nostalgic to me. The cinematography and choice to film digitally with a 55 mm lens to give the perfect aesthetic of 1970 made this movie so dreamy to me- They drink Miller High Life Champagne of beers. It made me weep towards the end. What someone will do for another is Amazing!"
Comedy,poor_things,"Destined to go down as one of 2023‚Äôs best and most memorable films, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos at the height of his peculiar power. Poor Things is a wildly entertaining quest for liberation and a true cinematic tour de force that wears its technicolor heart on its sleeve. It's easy to question the legitimacy of Yorgos Lanthimos's Poor Things in the first few minutes. Is it the story of a mad disfigured scientist holding a young woman hostage under the guise of science and fatherhood? Poor Things is not Lanthimos's best film. I believe The Killing of a Sacred Deer still holds that title, but this is the most fun Lanthimos' work on screen a deliriously droll cinematic whirligig that lands somewhere between Jean-Pierre Jeunet and the plastic ennui of And the Ship Sails On‚Ä¶but with eye-stabbing and mad science and ball gags. Lanthimos and McNamara throw in a hell of a lot in Poor Things. Thankfully, it‚Äôs a horny, gorgeous hell of a lot. Trust Lanthimos to make a film where the cast prepped by going to mortician school. Yet for all the delightful derangement, there's a refreshing lack of resignation... Poor Things is a very funny film, with acute social satire and an anti-romantic comedy premise rendered in gonzo, Gilliam-esque fashion. It‚Äôs also deeply cynical, though it justifies its own cynicism in its commitment to the bit. Emma Stone is fearless as a creature searching for her humanity in this twisted retelling.  I can honestly say that I appreciated Poor Things. I am less sure I can claim to have entirely enjoyed it. Stone is fabulous as a woman (re)discovering her zest for life, and Mark Ruffalo is a great, wickedly charming villain. If I had the choice of watching a final movie before giving up the ghost, it would have to be Poor Things. It ranks among my all-time personal favourites and is one of the wittiest and funniest films to hit cinema screens in years. There are not a lot of times where both actor and audience are having fun with a performance. Emma Stone was having the time of her life with Bella Baxter. ‚ÄúPoor Things‚Äù is Lanthimos‚Äô most optimistic film because the narrative arcs towards a utopian paradise cobbled together from society‚Äôs margins, the titular reference, except it would be a mistake to pity any of the characters  A statement about the illusion of bodily autonomy. Life is strange and then there‚Äôs Poor Things. Set in a steampunk world of Victorian custom, Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) learns to experience life in her own way even if it grates against societal norms. A film that needs to be seen to be believed and then experienced. Poor Things is proof that there is room for weirdly wonderful cinema in this world. ""Poor Things"" coincides with Emerld Fennell's ""Saltburn"" in confronting Hollywood's gun-happy format with something considerably more grounded, namely the sex urge that drives people, and the social curiosity that comes along with it. The best film of 2023. A Frankenstein Meets Forrest Gump flick filtered through a feminist focus.","Emma est√° perfeita e faz uma atua√ß√£o que se transforma! How can this out of from human mind? Amazing. 
Splendid casting crew Amazing story! This is one of my favorite movie now. And damn Emma Stone she‚Äô beautiful! Amazing. It is obvious that Emma Stone nominated in many types. Great movie This was quite possibly the worst movie I have seen. If Emma wasn't in this film, I don't think it would have been considered for the awards for which it was nominated. The themes were not of the sort I could relate to or found interesting whatsoever. Parts of it are blatantly pornographic and grotesque. Absolutely anger inducing how the first interactions with a ‚Äòtoddler‚Äô are sexual and then continues to get more explicit as the movie goes on. Felt like I was watching a pedophile‚Äôs fetish film. Horrendous video I want to wash my brain and hope there aren‚Äôt any other films ever made with similar themes or else we are headed into dark times. Camera tricks and outfits were just a gimmick for a truly disgusting plot. I've finished the movie and struggle to piece together the true meaning. Is it one of freedom? Where Bella Baxter experiences the world through both an adult and adolescent lens. An experience where she faces no constraints or restricitons such as marriage, religion, polite society, or even death and fear. Whatever the meaning means, the movie is pretty good. Emma Stone's performance capture Bella's capture likeness: from the dumbest person in the room towards the start of the film to being the smartest at the end. There is alot of sex in this movie though. Haven't felt so elevated since Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam's best work. Inspired by so many classics before him but using his own imagination and inner world Lanthimos created a twisted modern fairy tale, a stab to social norms and an advocate for uniqueness. This is a brave choice he made. A fantastic movie, like few others before it and with a cast whose performances will give you chills. Costumes, set and cinematography are pure perfection! Quirky and oddball film. Better than most modern movies, but still just okay. Be warned very explicit, lude, and awkward sex scenes. A few good laughs (Mark Ruffallo dancing) and nice costumes / set designs. Not a lot to take from this one, but a passably goofy film. Beautiful movie, Emily Stone‚Äôs best movie. worst movie ever seen. Terrible movie. I couldn‚Äôt even finish watching it. From its unique, pseudo-steampunk aesthetic to its winding, fable-like plot, Poor Things is a movie from which it is truly impossible to look away. It is intense in every way a film can be, and there were moments when my disgust threatened to overcome my sense of wide-eyed enchantment - but it never quite did. It‚Äôs a great movie that keeps you engaged from start to finish. It‚Äôs unconventional, standing out from other films with brilliant acting. I love its unique style; it‚Äôs truly one of a kind Weird but cool. Enjoyed the costumes a lot. Very visually pleasing. This movie will be a classic film because of its unique story telling and brilliant cast.  Emma Stone earned her Oscar for this. Uma obra cinematogr√°fica extremamente complexa, profunda e libertadora.
Emma espetacular em todos os sentidos. Dafoe totalmente insano (a met√°fora ficou incr√≠vel) e at√© o Mark Hulk conseguiu surpreender.

N√£o √© pra todos, mas deveria ser. Poor Things is an amazing movie with an amazing cast including Emma Stone. Just warning you that if you not used to sexual content, nudity, and disturbing stuff, this ain‚Äôt for you This is what happens when you let a man talk about femminist issues The best of the movie was the beautiful scenography, is like you live in a painting by Salvador Dal√≠, unfortunely, the plot was slow, they abused the sex scenes. It's not a bad movie, but I don't understand why it was selected as the film of the year by the Oscars."
Comedy,dream_scenario,"Borgli examines what happens to one‚Äôs self-image when thrust into the spotlight so suddenly, and when that goes wrong, what lasting harm is left? Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage) has a pretty great, if not uneventful life, but he yearns for more. His wants aren't completely out of bounds, he wants recognition, respect and the adoration of his family. Who could ask for anything more? Dream Scenario manages to create expectations during its first act, but the promises of something wild or interesting always remain at a distance; we can feel the potential, but the film never goes there Thankfully Borgli never allows his commentary on social media, masculinity, and modern celebrity to obscure the fact that our dreams can always potentially contain the sort of magic that can't always be a part of our waking life. Nicolas Cage delivers one of his best films, a study on fame, networks, and dreams. [Full review in Spanish] When the credits begin, the feeling of having had one of those great dreams interrupted, and that can never be resumed, arises. [Full review in Spanish] Given the challenge of playing someone who isn‚Äôt interesting, Cage does something interesting with every single scene. ...¬†He‚Äôs as surprisingly funny in¬†Dream Scenario as he was surprisingly dramatic and endearing in 2021‚Äôs¬†Pig. While there‚Äôs a strong hint of classic Kaufman to the surrealism, there‚Äôs nothing cliche or predictable in Dream Scenario. Borgli excels at creating an atmosphere that makes the viewer question whether the scene is happening or a dream. Each dream is like a short and would make a riveting film. It is like having a horror movie short film festival in one movie. It tells us a lot about the ephemerality of fame in the modern world, social media, advertising agencies and, somewhat randomly, technology. Nic Cage is sublime and I can't complain about the supporting performances either. Full review in Spanish, More like a dream that you only kinda enjoy, don‚Äôt really remember, and feel little need to share with someone else. There‚Äôs a lot going on in the performance, and it can be riveting on a number of levels. But I was left with the nagging feeling that Dream Scenario could‚Äôve and should‚Äôve been more than it is, with a conclusion that matches Cage‚Äôs complexity and gusto. Neither a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare, Borgli's far-reaching satire on cancel culture and metatextual reception theory overstays its welcome but finds Nicolas Cage in fantastic form as a victim of his own Jungian conundrum. This is a daring project not because of its crazy premise, but because of the almost perfect dissection it makes of a society obsessed with the fame of unknown people... [Full review in Spanish] A psychological fantasy satire that hits a nerve with just how real this surreal trip of a movie is.

 This movie is incredibly inventive. Nicolas Cage is fantastic in this role as a man who can't quite deal with all the things that are happening to him that he has no control over.  Dream Scenario turns its approach into an excuse for a light chapter of 'Black Mirror'. Luckily for everyone, nothing that Talking Heads' music can't fix. [Full review in Spanish] Kristoffer Borgli manages to compose a comedy with the soul of a horror film. [Full review in Spanish] A dystopian fable about cancel culture that borders the line between humor and terror. [Full review in Spanish] It is original and destabilizing, moving from the surreal and the sinister to comedy with total naturalness. [Full review in Spanish]","Dream Scenario is the kind of film that makes you wonder if Nicolas Cage was born to redefine 'over-the-top' or if 'over-the-top' was invented to keep up with Nicolas Cage. It's a masterclass in eccentricity, featuring Cage in a performance so quintessentially Nic Cage that it feels like he's playing every Nic Cage meme ever made. He navigates the bizarre plot with an intensity that suggests he‚Äôs not just acting but channelling an ancient, mystical Nic Cage energy from a dimension where subtlety is a banned substance. The movie is a fever dream of outlandish scenarios and Cage‚Äôs signature quirks, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the actor's unique brand of what can only be described as ""enthusiastic lunacy."" How is this possibly at a 91%? It was ambitious and occasionally visually compelling, but the whole story and writing was atrocious.  I kept waiting for it to get good and it just didn‚Äôt.  Nothing but boomer humor It starts off as an interesting premise but quickly becomes a hamfisted and lame attempt at a cancel culture allegory There are some details that make this feel real, but it's so bizarre your milage will vary probably based on your fondness for Nicolas Cage. It not a terrible supporting cast either, but this premise kinda runs thin. Nic Cage is showing up in people's dreams. I would have been curious why, but that mystery isn't brought up. There's a tangent in the third act that took this down a major step. The movie should make you think about fame and why the quest for it isn't what it's cracked up to be. I suspect that premise could be lost in Cage's performance. Final Score: 6.5/10 Dream Scenario is one of the best comic performance by Nicholas Cage is like what if Freddy Kruger having a his origin story going inside people and teens dreams and killing them and the script is really razor sharp brilliantly idea of balancing of dark comedy and fantasy in A24 film. A truely original, interesting movie, I was grabbed by it and it kept me intrigued! I really recommend Loved Nicolas Cage in this. Just felt it could have been a good movie with a different end. The premise is great, specially for a darker movie, which this isn't, sadly. Right away, that is one of the problems, the movie does not know what it is, it is listed as ""Comedy, Drama, Mystery, Thriller, Horror"". Just pick one or two, mate, not the whole catalog.
The first half of the movie is an easy 9/10, there is suspense and drama with a sprinkle of horror, the problem is that they did not really know what to do after that and took some weird turns leading to a really bad ending. Honestly, they should've leaned into the nightmares and terror, the maddening of the main character, the building rage and evil, the consequences, the suspense, etc., instead they just go ""the dream and  nightmares just stopped and no one knows why, and here is a dream product and a teen dream house of influencers"" like WTF!? Out of nowhere the movie takes a sharp turn and abandons the whole mystery, the dreams, the nightmares, the maddening, the rage, etc.
Movie goes from 9/10 to 2/10 in the blink of an eye, really sad to see that. Overall, a 4.5/10 just because the first half of the movie is so great and Cage's acting is on point. Amazing acting and the script is perfect! An interesting and unique tale that proves if your storytelling craft is strong, you don't need a big budget and over the top CGI to make a quality movie. Cage excels here, making boring interesting. A career highlight for him This might have to be one of the best movies I have ever seen I mean Nicholas Cage was amazing in his roll he played him perfectly and just the impact it had and how it made me feel is just WOW if you like sociological dramas and movies that make u question this is is a MUST SEE it is just amazing Dream Scenario is a great movie and a nice commentary on fame and the side effects that come with it and how people will try to profit on anything new and the problems that come with it. I would certainly recommend if you want to watch a weird movie that will leave you with questions after watching. Says it‚Äôs a comedy. If it is, it‚Äôs for a total of 10 minutes combined, if that much. Two thirds in goes downhill and finishes leaving the spectators wondering only one thing, ‚Äúwhy‚Äôd they lose their time watching this‚Äù. This movie is the type of movie that for some people, might require multiple viewings to truly understand all the concepts.
Problem is, although it's very different - which i apppreciate very much, in today's world of copy paste movies -, i don't think most people would be able to re-watch it.

Personally, i enjoyed the first half very much; it got me intrigued and hooked. But after all the weirdness that happens throughout the movie, i would have liked a more concise and definitive ending, instead of a more ambiguous and ""artsy"" one. 

At the end, i still enjoyed it but was left wanting more.

Nicholas Cage gives a great performance. One of his best ones. There were some quiet and emotional moments where he was giving it his all.

I think this is a good watch, ig you have company to you can discuss the movie's concepts and what is it about. This film will get under your skin and into your thoughts. Everything is going great until it suddenly isn‚Äôt. The power of the mind can be a frightening thing. Cage gives an exquisite performance in this provocative piece. I felt bad for him most of the movie, and there was always this tension of ‚Äòwhat kind of bad situation will this get him into next‚Äô. Kristoffer Borgli dreams up an unsettling apologue about a lecturer inexplicably appearing in dreams of millions to mull over abrupt notoriety, cancel culture and proceeds to make our heads swim with weightier issues of mediocrity of existentialism and needfulness for approval. Good acting but just depressing with no happy ending or any real explanation of what happened at all. Terrible! Movie starts slow and lacks any real substance. I understand the movie concept is interesting but this film is underwhelming and not entertaining. I watched about an hour before turning off. Yo la primera mitad de la pel√≠cula: Ay que bonito, Nicolas Cage est√° recibiendo la atenci√≥n de todos.
Yo la segunda mitad de la pel√≠cula: Mendigo coraje tengo atorado, m√°talos a todos de una vez."
Comedy,love_actually,"Set to the backdrop of Christmas, Love Actually finds believability in the unbelievable, crafting an environment where anything can happen and the greatest risks should be taken. The film is all but stolen... by Bill Nighy as a washed up rock star goofing his way through his holiday TV and radio appearances as his seasonal song climbs the charts. ... Curtis and company remind us that love, actually, is everywhere no matter the time of year, period, or place. That‚Äôs what helps make it a staple watch this and any other time of year. A cringe 10 for the price of one bulk holiday sale of the most well-worn rom-com tropes. The film simply has an attractive charm about it that pulls you in and keeps you interested.  Richard Curtis‚Äô Love Actually claims the prize of being the ‚Äúultimate romantic comedy‚Äù not through daring or originality, but by covering every clich√© imaginable offered by the genre, and doing so with style. ...while Curtis clearly connects more with some stories than others, the best bits are genuinely classics... The work is lopsided and misshapen, not like life, but a poor, contrived, somewhat disoriented impression of life. A load of sickeningly twee nonsense inflated, bizarrely, into some kind of totemic Christmas film that only humbugs suggest might not just be rubbish. It's almost a shock to see such a well constructed and beautifully acted scene (Emma Thompson opening her present) amid the rest of this film's more mainstream machinations. A collection of touching sketches that are frequently sentimental yet thoroughly grand. It's a tremendous romantic comedy that far outshines most American comedies. Curtis pulls off a spectacular feat of screenwriting, expertly defining 16 principal characters and their relationships, providing each one with a beginning, middle, and end, and making us care about what happens to all of them. There's so much right and yummy about this multi-tiered plum cake of a romantic comedy. The film exhibits a real soft spot for sexual predators, while also promoting the notion that Christmas is the perfect time to publicly dump your love on the near-stranger you're tenderly stalking. Now, though, Curtis, England's most successful comic screenwriter, has shown that when it comes to Hollywood pap, the English can teach Hollywood a treacly trick or two. This plum pudding of a romantic comedy is rich with delicious moments. Love Actually isn't in love with anyone except itself: it's like watching a practised lounge lizard go through his repertoire. Forget about stiff upper lips. Though very British, this irresistible ensemble comedy will easily coax full-sized grins of enjoyment from viewers. If you feel yourself glowing after Love Actually, you might be suffering from sugar shock.","Possibly the most syrupy, written-on-the-back-of-a-beermat scripts in the history of cinema. Cringe-worthy dialogue delivered from some of the greatest actors of our time (and why they agreed to it is a mystery to me. Did they read the script before they signed up?). Why and how did Richard Curtis become a writer working for an audience that is the least discerning group possible? Contrived, saccharine, soft, simplistic and just plain painful. Makes Notting Hill look scalpel sharp by comparison. This one has suffered a bit of a backlash. It's still one of Richard Curtis' best. Second only to Four Weddings, and better in my opinion, than Notting Hill. The ultime romantic comedy One of my favourite movies. Makes me love christmas and love love. This movie had me at the wedding scene. So many layers! Very refreshing and gives you a hopeful perspective on Love Actually. ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Also, I love seeing a younger Andrew Lincoln, he's a very versatile actor. There is a popular notion that this movie is very romantic. I guess if stalking is romantic, and being mean to people is being in love with them. This is a highly problematic film. This movie seriously grew on me over time. I remember when I first saw it, I thought it was too convoluted and I couldn't keep track of all the love stories, but over the years through several exposures I was able to put that aside and simply revel in how adorable, real, and heartwarming each tale really is. I love watching this movie around the holidays! Linda historia de amor. Buen ritmo, es llevadera y se deja ver. Good flick. Loved the guy who got all the chicks in Milwaukee Good flick.  Loved the dude who got all the girls in the US Love Actually falls short as a good movie, presenting itself as an anthology of different stories with pieces connecting them. While there might be some likable elements in each story, it's a written mess carried by its actors, whom you might only watch because you appreciate their work outside of this film. They deliver an okay performance, but the lack of substantial material limits their impact. For a film exploring different types and ways of love, every story feels incredibly shallow, featuring characters making stupid decisions without much payoff. Despite being a Christmas film with entertaining actors, the overall lack of meaningful events may leave you questioning whether it was worth watching. It's a divisive film, and while some may really hate it or love it, I land on the 'do not care' side of the reception for this film. A movie with this many stories and characters was destined to be a highlight reel. However, the highlights (or negatives) are quite enjoyable and played by a more than capable cast. None of the stories have true depth, but it's a pleasing slideshow. When it comes to love, we find it comes in many forms and in mysterious ways. Showcasing the truest bits of love found in everyday life, Love Actually gives us multiple stories of a human struggle. Starting off a bit slow, the individual relationships are all fleshed out distinctly and create a very unique and charming tale. While each story is fairly entertaining, some of them are worth more emotional investment, leaving others feeling like perfect bathroom breaks. Although it isn't perfect, it all comes together in a beautiful ensemble in the end. Complete with an all star cast, this film is an English 'Who's Who' of celebrities, each adding a cute and fun performance to their story. It is fun getting to see these big actors interacting in such quirky ways and taking on roles that are delightfully unexpected. Love Actually takes us on a very real and human journey through the love and lives of different individuals, reminding us that it comes we are all just people, in need of love. Awesome film, funny and classically British. Still an iconic film 20 years on. The cast were brilliant, perfect I thought, and overall the film was a brilliant warm Christmas film. This is a classic with an amazing cast. I actually really enjoyed Love Actually. Loved Actually is a 2003 Romantic/Comedy/Drama set around Christmas time. The film has many storylines that encompasses multiple characters during it's 2 hour+ run time who are searching for love. While I enjoyed jumping into one characters story to the next it can sometimes be a jumble mess which requires alot of patience on the audience who is watcing. There are a lot of big name celeberities in this film from Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, and Andrew Lincoln to name a few. If you really enjoy a good romantic Christmas movie then you need to check out Love Actually. Love Actually gets a very solid 4 stars out of 5 from. The best Christmas movie ever! Its not just a movie it's an emotion!!  Love it! A fantastic, fun filled festive film. 
Loads of sub stories all fitting in nicely into the overall story. 
Superb cast and simply sit back and enjoy. This movie is a classic romance, mixed with comedy, drama and feel good moments. This all-star team of Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy and the beloved Liam Neeson. All the brits come out for a Christmas special that tugs at all the different parts of LOVE - loss, closure, success and failures. Dreaming and working for what feels impossible to make it a reality. 2nd favorite holiday and rom-come movie. The Holiday is number one"
Comedy,next_goal_wins_2023,"With such steadfast faith in audiences, it‚Äôs a wonder the film didn‚Äôt include a laugh track. It‚Äôs also supremely apt that, like the team featured in the film, Waititi fumbles the ball at every turn. Next Goal Wins is uplifting, silly, predictable, but also basic.  Taika Waititi masterfully combines humor with themes of identity in Next Goal Wins, highlighting his distinctive style. Imperfect and struggles to make a splash in the wake of Ted Lasso, but it‚Äôs still an sweet, uplifting ride ... ""Next Goal Wins"" offers viewers a film that plays like comfort food: inviting, enjoyable, and filling. It may not work for everyone, but if you‚Äôre in the camp that leans more toward Waititi‚Äôs wavelength, ""Next Goal Wins"" scores. You know how it's going to end, but you can't resist watching it again because it makes you feel good to watch it. ... the joy and satisfaction comes from how the film has been prepared and served. Let's just say: it's a good treat. Next Goal Wins misses the net way too many times. Though not without its flaws, this comedy-drama may not reach the heights of greatness, but it undeniably succeeds in delivering entertainment value, making it a worthwhile watch for those seeking light-hearted uplifting entertainment. Rather than push himself outside his comfort zone, Waititi doubles down on his signature style.
 The plot of Next Goal Wins is perched on repeated digs at how island life is rooted in faith and exoticised by the West, but ultimately, the film ends up leaning into precisely those same clich√©s.  A heartwarming yet slightly disjointed tale. Some strong performances that make it a charming underdog story. Through the lens presented and intended audience, Next Goal Wins works best on surface. The MƒÅori & Pasifika talent form the foundation of all it's warmth. While there was warmth, I was yearning for effervescent heat. Takes what should be an inspirational and heartwarming story and makes it awkward and cringey. The film gamely ticks several boxes viewers have come to expect from against-the-odds sports movies. Even the jokes that take aim at its own white saviour narrative are eye-rolling. Yes, this movie is full of self deprecating humour and silliness but it still delivers. An inspiring set-piece that drives home the importance of teamwork and understanding, but all in the most surface level of manners Taika Waititi surprises with his complete lack of a pulse in a conventional, cheesy and, at times, even slightly racist comedy. [Full review in Spanish]  With this story this film could have been something really special but sadly Waititi misses the mark and makes this film something it shouldn't be.","**Next Goal Wins** is a heartwarming and humorous ride that takes us into the world of the American Samoa national soccer team, once dubbed the worst in the world. Directed by Taika Waititi, the film delivers a predictable yet undeniably charming underdog story. Michael Fassbender stars as Thomas Rongen, the eccentric coach tasked with turning the ragtag team into serious contenders. 

Though you can see the ending coming from a mile away, the journey there is filled with quirky characters, endearing moments, and a lot of heart. Waititi‚Äôs unique comedic touch adds a lighthearted spin to the typical sports narrative, making it feel fresh despite its familiar beats. The movie shines with its vibrant depiction of island life and the infectious spirit of the team. **Next Goal Wins** might not surprise you, but it will surely leave you smiling. A solid 3.5-star feel-good flick! Next Goal Wins is a hilarious, sweet, and charming story. My theater was cracking up the whole time. The plot is based on a true story and packed with Samoan tradition and culture, which I love to see on the big screen. The plot itself was pretty typical and it has some similarities to other underdog sport stories. It‚Äôs pacing was fast and I kinda wish they would have dived more into character development and such. But it‚Äôs short and simple film. Yes, it was predictable, but a light-hearted warm romp that was entertaining and an enjoyable watch! Missed the mark. Taika makes great films, not this one. Despite the fabulous casting, it was an awkward ride. Second-hand embarrassment abounds. Very heartwarming and entertaining. Loved the movie, sometimes subtle, sometimes slapstick balanced out with deep emotions As with most of Taika Waititi's movies, this seems to be well intentioned but is a colossal, unfocused, and mostly unfunny mess.  The film is extremely uneven with continuity errors in how character behave and with this approaches to things.  
It is more a stream of consciousness without anyone willing to tell Taika Waititi to focus it.
I don't see why he is held on such high regard because (with the exception of The Wilder People) all of his movies are fairly amateurish and flimsy. NEXT GOAL WINS brings Taika Waititi's considerable talents to an indigenous underdog story loosely based on actual events. The film both utilizes and subverts the inspirational sports movie formula to present a engaging portrait of achievement against the odds that is  humorous and heartful in equal measure, and somehow manages to maintain viewers' investment in a rather unlikable central character long enough for real sympathy to surface. Understated and intentional, this culturally-insightful film scores big. I felt as if this could have been better, considering Taika Waititi's other work. There were some funny moments and some heartfelt moments. It was a formulaic underdog sports movie complete with a training montage. Now there is nothing wrong with this formula when making a comfort movie. However, I think the most interesting parts were learning about the characters and the culture of American Samoa. This movie had comedy and heart, it's what needed during these times, I'm not expecting an Oscar winning movie, so I don't know why the critics are being so harsh! Sweet and funny, it's worth a watch. The story is pretty predictable, but the characters make watching this film a bit like a gentle trip away somewhere warm and relaxed. Beautiful acting and just generally lovely. It was an enjoyable heart-warming film that had a predictable progression. though i enjoyed watching i could easily guess what was going to happen next. i would say don't completely remove  next goal wins from your watch list. Pretty much what I expected...

An adaptation of the documentary (that I adore btw) with Taika's comedic flare. While it isn't taking itself too seriously, it still provides emotions, deep themes, and is such a feel good story that by the end, you can't help but smile. Although I do wish a certain character got a bit more of her story told as it was easily the most compelling subplot of the film. It was quick, got plenty of laughs and chuckles out of me, and ultimately didn't really disappoint me. It's no Jojo rabbit but it's a nice pit stop for laughs, fun, charm, and spirit. I honestly don't get why Next Goal Wins has a 45% on the tomatometer. This movie is heart-warming, funny and very underrated. Highly recommend it Taika, ten√≠as en tus manos a la mejor pel√≠cula de tu carrera, l√°stima que tambi√©n la quisiste hacer una comedia barata. The critics are soulless and dead wrong. Creative comic Taika Waititi acknowledges the formulaic challenges at the same time frivolously approaches the subject with balanced hits and misses under tiresome amusement, while adapting an earlier eponymous documentary broadly surfaces, this pure underdog story is funny and just as climatically effective with worthy cheers whilst equally benefitting from Michael Fassbender's game performance. (B) Really cute and quirky film!  Taika Waititi and his standard players deliver fun and the story itself has the heart.  Good performances from all involved but really just fun to watch!  4 stars"
Comedy,fallen_leaves,"The film exudes a quiet sorrowfulness that informs every plot beat and every visual choice. The fleeting beauty of temporal happiness is no less beautiful. That‚Äôs the poetic heartbeat of Aki Kaurism√§ki‚Äôs latest film, Fallen Leaves However understated, Kaurismaki‚Äôs film also offers a warm love story about two lonely people, one alcoholic, struggling to break out of their dead-end lives. ... No matter how bleak life can be, Kaurismaki suggests, there is hope. One of 2023's 20 best films. Kaurismaki emphasizes human resilience and the value of love with his filmmaking gestures, in an absolutely gorgeous and hugely affirming love story. It‚Äôs one of those pure delights that‚Äôs hard to resist. An odd couple story seasoned with playful inconsistencies and deadpan humour that brings,  or appears to bring, unlikely lovers together in an out-of-kilter society In any case, it is an interesting film that deserves to be seen for its unconventional style and its audiovisual features. [Full review in Spanish] Just like in his previous works, the director employs a subtle and, ultimately, poetic humor, with stoic and distant characters who nonetheless manage to captivate our sensitivity [Full review in Spanish] By design, Fallen Leaves isn‚Äôt so much a romance as a series of gestures towards the idea of one. You can‚Äôt tell this kind of story any more, is the implication, but wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if you could? Nobody speaks unless they have to, although there is a wealth of wordless communication. At a time when movies seem to be getting longer and longer, Kaurism√§ki keeps everything under 90 minutes. Thoroughly boring...An arthouse sedative. This movie does follow that arc in its own way. It feels like there‚Äôs a big beating heart awaiting its moment. In paying homage to Finnish culture, Fallen Leaves might prove to be a valedictory statement from one of the world's great auteurs. Like all great films, Fallen Leaves makes us ponder deeply our philosophy of life. This quietly funny and endearingly gruff movie keeps you hoping our two would-be lovers will be together by the time the final credits roll. Wonderful stuff. While sad songs punctuate and homages to many great romantic films where two would be lovers are separated and need to find their ways to one another play out, the Finnish master makes room in our darkest times for us to smile, even for a short while.  The drabness of low-rung lives is saut√©ed reindeer and mashed potatoes to Finnish film-maker Aki Kaurism√§ki. Fallen Leaves drops its couple into a place that includes hope and makes for an oddly nice film, one that mixes grim reality with optimistic acceptance. Perhaps what is most gratifying about Kaurism√§ki‚Äôs work is the way that he is able to balance his po-faced ironic tone with a genuine, and acutely tender, melancholy. The occasional jokes are as funny as they are deadpan. The little gestures and touches of affection between the characters are both plausible and endearing. There is no straining for effect, but it lifts your mood by osmosis. Restrained but radiant, Finnish auteur Aki Kaurism√§ki's Cannes hit is an achingly romantic drama about two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl.","I have watched this film at cinema club this evening. I thought it was poor.  I wouldn't want to go to Finland if that's what it's like. Depressing from start to finish. Though I was engaged by the lead actors, I found the  stylized approach to all characters in the movie irritating. There‚Äôs deadpanned and then there‚Äôs stilted. Everyone acts as if revealing some warmth or cracking half a smile will cause an explosion. Beautiful work of art, best movie I have seen in years When love is missing from your life, addictions and self-sabotage creep in. Simple plot not original,  but time passes smoothly enough.  
Finish people really this dour? Is said to be happiest country on earth. 
Seriously? Continuing in his trademark of minimalist filmmaking, deadpan humour and his fondness for retro, Aki Kaurism√§ki crafts a romantic tragicomedy about two lonely proletariats meeting cute in a karaoke bar and tumbles into a clumsy pursuit of love so simply told, it endears with a timeless nostalgia. Often hilarious and the movie has own unique style (anachronisms coupled with a serious love of classic cinema). The two leads are absolutely perfect. Kaurism√§ki delivers as always Another amazing work from Finnish Filmmaker Aki Kaurism√§ki Might be the worst movie I have ever seen. I felt like I was watching the college thesis from a C- film student. The lighting was horrible. The story was boring. The characters have no depth. The filmmaker gives us no reason to care. The positive reviews from the critics are mind-blowing. How could anyone actually enjoy this? There is nothing about it that is interesting at all. Good film, unusual humor, slow paced. You might think of it as a Finnish version of Marty-two characters with not much going for them think that being together will make things better. Hope they are right. A staple of Finnishness. Be prepared for awkward silences. Very slow burner ,and not very satisfying.
Not a smile in sight .No energy ! Original, well-rounded story of love in poverty Thought it was a polish movie for the entire time‚Ä¶ kaurism√§kii doesn't disappoint, this is brilliant on many levels ""Fallen Leaves"" is short and sweet. This movie has enough of a positive vibe with some quirky humor to make it a unique watch. I feel like I was more invested in the movie in the first half and because it doesn't run for that long, I felt like it could have been longer and deeper. I liked everything presented here and think it is a technically well-made film, I just finished it wanting more than what was on the surface. Overall, it is a good movie that means well which left me with a positive feeling and celebrates the connections between everyday people which is something I can ultimately support and get behind. Wow! Wonderfully quirky. You'll either love it or not get it. Deadpan, dour beauty and silence used to great effect. It's slow paced yet you get drawn in. A Finnish tragicomedy romance where hope exists despite tough personal battles and depressing world issues. 
The soundtrack builds engagement and forms part of the storytelling. The song ""Born with sadness and clothed in disappointment"" captures the mood. very enjoyable and warm and funny, highly recommended Beautifully raw love story with deeply human undercurrents. Music and songs spot on (even Maustetyt√∂t). I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who's seen downsides of life, and therefore respects even little sparks of light, here and there."
Comedy,barbie,"Gerwig and Baumbach offer thoughtful commentary not only on Barbie herself and everything she represents, but also on womanhood, feminism, and growing up. Add it all up and we get an enchanting explosion of pink cotton candy fun, all of which conceals a deceptively nutritious sociopolitical core. Can we all just ‚ÄúBeach‚Äù? Barbie is equal parts a feminist rallying cry, an educational film, a reaffirmation of healthy matriarchal values, a musical, a comedy, and the kind of movie that everyone, especially young men, should see. Beneath all the laughs at the expense of men and women is the sad truth that this brand of essentialism itself, of separating Barbies from Kens, of emphasizing their differences, is the thing that damages us the most. Before she hits the road, being in Barbie Land is just as pleasurable for the viewer as it is for these toys. The depiction of this world is a triumph of imaginative design and skilful craftsmanship. That Gerwig was able to essentially hijack a two-hour toy commercial (and a magnificently visualized one at that), one that cost $150 million, and deliver something approximating a progressive message, is just short of miraculous. Why was this made? Throw in Billie Eilish‚Äôs melancholic tear-jerker and an intentionally butchered pronunciation of The Godfather and the movie was bound to be an instant classic. And you, too, have the power to take your Birkenstocks out of the closet in 2024. One of the main keys to Barbie‚Äôs success is commitment to the Barbieland authenticity and Gerwig‚Äôs willingness to undercut both Barbie and Ken leads, only to build them back up again. Barbie‚Äôs highs more than make up for its shaky third act. The game cast‚Äôs commitment to the tone, dazzling visuals and spirited direction prove it‚Äôs not a bad thing visiting Barbie‚Äôs World even if it‚Äôs just a break from the real one. One of the most thought-provoking social commentaries and empowering mainstream comedies in recent years. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Just Ken‚Äù scene should be playing on a loop in the Louvre. Gerwig had given no indication she (or anybody, really) could produce such a hot-pink masterpiece of goofball humor, winsome Jacques Tati alienation, and low-key patriarchy seminar.  Barbie is very entertaining and despite the apparent artificiality, it questions social mandates. Throughout the film, a successful sense of humor is maintained regarding the struggle of the sexes and its cultural implications, without being offensive. In Greta we trust.  With a stellar cast of actors, Barbie focuses all the energy of its first half hour on running through this insular version of things. [Full Review in Spanish] Barbie is a brand extension exercise, but it's an audacious, hilarious, and artistically crafted one, raising the bar considerably for big-budget intellectual property ventures to come.

Was pleasantly surprised by this film, went in with low expectations and came out loving the film for it's great story and message , and Margot Robbie IS Barbie üî•ü§©üòéüëçüèªüëçüèª This feels like 5 different movies every 2 minutes ,it feels like they don‚Äôt know where they are going with this movie. But besides that the movies good but at the same time I‚Äôm a boy and I didn‚Äôt grow up with Barbies 3/5 starts or 6.6/10 very cute barbie with blond hair Bieng too perfect is sometimes a mess. lovely!! I am very happy that the movie shows us the steps and choices that are necessary in the life of a great person. I like the movie. har to skip forward several times, so i didn't puke I saw Barbie in the theaters five times! I don't even have the words to describe my love for this movie. YOU ARE KENOUGHüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüî•üî•üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüî•üî•ü•∂ü•∂ great movie, but I think there could have been a better way to show the self-discovery process. it all felt a little... rushed.i felt that I couldn't keep up with the happening of the movie. but the worst part for me was that there was no actual plot if you think about it. just little scraps of stories put together. Se perdieron muchos chistes del ingl√©s al espa√±ol :/ This might be the only movie I went to see multiple times in theaters! Same with my friends - I know people who rewatched it three to seven times. Definitely the cultural event of the year!

Honestly, it‚Äôs amazing re-watch value comes from the great social commentary, beautiful pastel aesthetic, and top-notch soundtrack. Acting by all the main cast was great, and Margot Robbie and America Ferrera really enraptured me with their acting. Bom filme, acho que deixa bem claro o quanto o patriarcado √© contagiante! i saw it in the cinemas like 1 times Barbie I have it on Blu Ray From Canada I did saw it in the theatres after the movie i vomit i give it a 2 of 10   ü§Æits was at cineplex cinemas queensway theatre and vip  i only like it on Amazon Prime Video ""Ryan Gosling's performance was tremendous; at least someone gave the movie meaning. All his awards are well deserved. üëå dragged a tiny bit but really thought the first hour was just incredible nice background sets, but plot is a bit predictable so skipped a lot bc no tension Barbie's aggressively pink, initially cringeworthy approach may be visually unappetizing to some viewers, but a surprisingly emotional, nuanced story helps propel Greta Gerwig's plastic comedy high above others in the toy aisle."
Comedy,the_persian_version,"It‚Äôs a noble but flawed look at a culture that nonetheless deserves its time in the spotlight. As The Persian Version flits back and forth between the past and present and between America and Iran, we see how even the slightest change in perspective can allow us to see, perhaps even appreciate, a situation in a whole new light. It‚Äôs not perfect, but The Persian Version is a mighty salute to not just Keshavarz‚Äôs own mothers, but mothers and women all over the world, fighting for a better future and a better life, regardless of their conditions.  Among the joyous dance sequences and near-farcical moments, The Persian Version digs for emotional truths and finds them. Don‚Äôt let the first 15 minutes of this rousing modern melodrama fool you. Maryam Keshavarz‚Äôs drama is an astute dissection of mother-daughter discord; it‚Äôs perceptive and candid in its insights into the push-pull cultural struggle experienced by second-generation immigrants. Keshavarz cranks up the charm, and the feelgood factor makes it an easy watch ‚Äì despite some of the gags feeling more suited to a TV sitcom. The generational strike of The Persian Version is something that‚Äôs been explored before, to greater effect. However, a fine cast and creative storytelling ensure this is a journey that people from all walks of life can latch on to. Describing itself as ‚Äòa true story ‚Äì sort of‚Äô, The Persian Version blends comedy and family drama to great effect, showing us a good deal more than its heroine and narrator intends us to see. Girls succeed, and fun remains the operating mood for The Persian Version movie. A vibrant comedy that perfectly balances the film‚Äôs dramatic overtone with continuous pockets of levity. It‚Äôs a story of determination and independence, filled with headstrong female characters overcoming misogynistic prejudice. It's also a lot of fun Though Leila is an engaging and sympathetic character, Shireen‚Äôs saga is the more engrossing as she ascends from child bride to enterprising businesswoman and champion to immigrants trying to achieve the American dream.  Once you get past the feeling of wanting more, The Persian Version is a heartwarming -- and often heartbreaking -- exploration of a mother and daughter repairing their future relationship by confronting their past. You can admire writer-director Maryam Keshavarz‚Äôs   ambition, but the effect is like watching a juggler trying to keep too many balls in the air at once. Filled with laughter, heart, and excellent work from Layla Mohammadi and Niousha Noor, The Persian Version is a delight to watch. ... recombines familiar themes into a fresh and vibrant package that manages a heartfelt mix of humor and sentiment. A filmmaker who has been around for more than a decade suddenly establishes herself as a bold new comic voice in The Persian Version. I‚Äôd welcome more of this (and some more filmmaking discipline) from her and her leading lady. Too many shifts in times, tones, and ideas crowd the earnest intentions. A comedy in bold, candied colors and spirited performances, Maryam Keshavarz‚Äôs <I>The Persian Version</I> sings, zings and even stings with cultural specificity... Madcap dashes... rise above the potent danger for a descent into therapeutic digression.  One of the year‚Äôs most surprisingly potent small discoveries.","I saw the Persian version and let me start off by saying I‚Äôm Persian so I‚Äôm completely biased. As an Iranian American, I really enjoyed this movie because it‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt see often. I‚Äôve seen representation on screen in the past but this was different. I‚Äôve seen movies made for Iranians and I‚Äôve seen Iranians as side characters in tv and film. But this felt like it was for a non Iranian audience. They showed a lot of things that I‚Äôve experienced in my culture, but did it in a way that explains what happened. It felt like the audience was meant to experience what the main character was feeling in real time. There were things I didn‚Äôt exactly love and some of the things in the movie were a little over exaggerated, but overall I did like it. a touching story that has some trouble balancing it‚Äôs comedic and serious tones.

and i don‚Äôt think narration is immediately a bad quality in a film, but there is a lot here. probably too much, in my opinion. Must see movie with great acting and directing. Disrespectful movie about religion and culture Hate Speech against Shia Islam and Imam e Zaman (as). This is very lively and entertaining. I also learned a lot about Iranian culture, in an engaging way. Unexpected and deep story. Beautiful and creative flow. Tight script and very good delivery. Utter disrepect to a religion is not what any movie should do to gain viewers. It shows false theology and gives completely wrong information on love and belief of people. If a movie has to get to down to this to get views, it is utter shame! There is no point watching any part of this movie if the mindset of the director and writer is as such to push anything into the movie without any responsibility.

I wish other viewers understand this and question the movie makers as to why was it needed for them to portray a false theology of the religion to people, and not only a false theology but a mockery on the beliefs of the people.

0 stars for the movie. This movie is completely showing false and distracting young youth and who ever non muslim is watching I would like to say them first know what islam is and who is imam zaman and there are various true incidents where imam zaman had appeared to help ppl the it's a long topic I don't want to discuss it here just the conclusion here is the all story is of fake and falsehood plz dont take it serious it's completely spreading falsehood.... thanks There's a scene in the movie in which an Islamic figure, by the name of Imam Zaman, was humiliated and the feelings of Shia Muslims were hurt in the guise of cheap comedy. Learn to narrate stories without crossing boundaries and know how to practice basic manners and show respect towards fellow humans, regardless of their faith. Highly disappointed! I just say that remove the whole part of Imam Mehdi because this is very irrelevant and The name of the movie is: ‚ÄòThe Persian Version' which has many problems and insults. It mocks the belief in Imam Mehdi (a) and claims he comes to help in animal form as well other unacceptable descriptions. Absolute trash - don't waste your time. Completely disrespectful of Shia beliefs and so uncultured. If I could give a minus star I would Absolute waste of time. The bad acting, the forced plot of an immigrant family's life & then continue to NOT depict the culture & lives of immigrant. The movie specifically targets the muslim beliefs and if there was a negative rating possible I give it negative rating. I'm distasteful and misleading depiction of religious beliefs, star of the show needs paycheck and will read any script passed to her. Terrible movie; don't waste your time on it This movie show wrong information. Horrible. Misrepresentation of Shia Muslims. Mockery of religious beliefs by spread of false information. Attempt to disrespect beliefs of Shia Muslims by misguiding audience regarding their beliefs. Very inconsiderate and factually incorrect in addressing the religious beliefs of a particular sect. This movie which aimed to show the Iranian beliefs and lifestyle is totally not what it meant to be. The houses and traditions were not at all Iranian and more like Indian. And not only this, the WORST of all was how the filmmakers and the writers as well as the actors decided to stoop as low as they can by deciding that it was somehow okay to be disrespectful to the Muslim beliefs!! By saying that Imam e Zamana (AJTF) appears out of no where in a suspicious way and could come in the form of an animal (Nauzubillah) was absolutely vile! Calling the beliefs of Shia Muslims magic and whatnot. How is it okay to be disrespectful to the religious beliefs of a community while unsuccessfully trying to depict their culture? I felt absolutely disgusted and triggered by seeing that my beliefs are now going to be presented by someone who's not even close to knowing the reality, in such a twisted way. If it was possible, I would've given a negative rating to this excuse of a movie. This topic is extremely sensitive on the muslims belief and it also insults Islamic religion..grow up why gotta make such false imformated movies about religion..and how about you make a movie about the ongoing genocide i think it's much better to talk about the the truth that's going on today than informing fake information about a religion...this is the shittiest movie i've ever watched.."
Comedy,scrapper_2023,"Scrapper is about opening up and how a girl who is so steadfastly independent learns it is okay to need someone. Yet Charlotte Regan adds fun and inventiveness to this, creating a kitchen sink drama with a modern visual style. The movie leads us to reflect on aspects related to parenting, the responsibility of young people who become parents without much thought, and the effects of forced maturity on children obliged to work even at school age. [Full review in Spanish] There were a lot of wonderful moments throughout and I look forward to seeing what this young director does next. The Xavier Dolan-esque jump cuts and the intersecting video game sequences are a (satisfying) distraction from the heart of the film, but they are still enjoyable to watch. Charlotte Regan‚Äôs Scrapper features an absolute knockout debut performance from Lola Campbell as Georgie The movie's secret weapon is its leading duo: an old soul trapped in a young girl's body and a 30-year-old who's a teen at heart. It's a potentially flammable combination sustained by an effortless chemistry between Campbell and Dickinson. Downbeat but uplifting. [Scrapper] finds some fascinating things to tell, and is charming in its form and conclusion, thus launching the career of a director who may have many more things to say. [Full review in Spanish] Charlotte Regan delves with delicacy and humor, without avoiding the dramatic aspects, into the clumsy but sincere relationship between a girl and her absent father... [Full review in Spanish] Amidst all the intentional artificiality of the filmmaking, [Campbell and Dickinson's] largely improvised interactions never ring false ‚Äî a dynamic that‚Äôs crucial to making the movie feel genuinely touching and real rather than saccharine and shallow.  There is community and light to spare for some new (and nice) angry young people. [Full review in Spanish] Scrapper is constantly animated by a spirit of fun, as if Regan and her team couldn‚Äôt bring themselves to dwell too long on the sad bits. Scrapper refuses to be pigeonholed as another dreary story about working-class life. Grief has hope, youth holds the keys to everything. Scrapper director Charlotte Regan, who hails from this working-class London milieu, effortlessly captures how the community wildly crisscrosses in the shared spaces around their pastel, candy-colored flats. Director Charlotte Regan handles these matters with a candy-colored levity that can quite often be charming, in a whimsical, Wes Anderson way, but sometimes just plain baffling. A really remarkable directorial debut. It's a quirky, weird, delightful and offbeat film.  Think of it as the bastard offspring of Charlotte Wells‚Äôs Aftersun and Sean Baker‚Äôs The Florida Project, with a little Wes Anderson thrown into the mix... Even as it heads exactly where you‚Äôre expecting, her simple story grows just as likable and touching as it intends. Scrapper has the charm to burst through the coldest of hearts and win you over with whimsy, bants and working class joy. A poignant tale of rediscovery. Dickinson & newcomer Campbell shine in this gritty, yet heartwarming father-daughter narrative. A testament to resilience, growth, and the ties that bind.","a somewhat familiar coming of age story revitalized with a unique style, voice and perspective. Implausible conceit, juvenile writing & filmmaking and just plain offensive towards working-class kids and parents, along with teachers and social services.

God bless british independent cinema, but surely it doesn't have to be this dumb and cloying? also Dickinson has never starred in a single decent movie, and this is just an AFTERSUN reject without the cinematic prowess , ambition and storytelling power that Charlotte Wells brings to the table. One to seriously avoid. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't understand much of the dialogue. We rented it from a streaming service and had turned on CC but apparently there was no closed caption available. I blame that on cheap production. Too bad. Predictable but there is a touching resolution that feels earned. A beautiful film. It paid close attention to character development- it neither felt too long or too short in introducing its characters and their arcs. I have no criticisms whatsoever. Will be recommending this ASAP. Great acting all around. Heart-warming tale that doesn't spare the grit of a lower-class existence. Really enjoyed, excellent story and acting... Very tender movie about dealing with grief. Great acting from some stars of the future. Great !! Typical ""slice of life "" British movie. We loved it!! (Just tobhear the social worker say that Georgie's uncle was ""winston churchill"" and she believed it was worth it!) Well made, well-acted and quite compelling. A fairly low budget takes nothing away from a well-crafted storyline. I am sad to say that I really wanted to like this movie‚Ä¶. Brilliant subject and idea but I found it to be very contrived ‚Ä¶ I've worked with children in challenging situations similar to this and the vocabulary and script this young actor has been given just does not ring true‚Ä¶ disappointed  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I loved it such a charming movie I'm not crying, you are....a wonderful movie. Basically its about grief and coping and growing up. But it's still positive and charming. Wonderful. It's a very interesting movie with good acting and storyline. It's definitely worth the watch. The movie becomes interesting when the father shows up. It is a little dull before that time, and glorifying child thief and bicycle thief is not funny either. Funny, endearing, authentic. Terribly sweet. Slow moving, but well worth the time spent. Touching story of a kid who loses her mom only to have a unexpected dad appear This movie was a wonderful surprise.  It was billed as a comedy ... I cried my eyes out. A beautifully told and shot movie about grief It's a wonderful movie.  The happy ending may not be realistic, but harsh reality is not for everyone."
Comedy,waitress_the_musical,"It‚Äôs a marriage, not of convenience or of once-burning-hot desire, but of proper affection and respect, one where audiences will not forget this is a play first, even while being swept up by it through the performances and songs. The end does feel a bit rushed (in order to cram in a happy conclusion), but ultimately, Waitress: The Musical proves why it has become so beloved among Broadway fans. Sara Bareilles has a wonderful, lovely presence. She's so likable, she's so grounded, she has the most crystal clear, beautiful voice, and these songs are also lovely. !t it is really quite wonderful. Although heavily skewed towards its star and full of high-calorie 2010s music and staging trends, Waitress: The Musical is a delicious experience. Beautiful songs telling a compelling journey  Watch the film version of the musical, and you‚Äôll find out what baking can do. Baking up a storm of humor and heart, the pro-shot Broadway production with Bareilles leading the charge is the perfect treat this holiday season. While Waitress is still probably a dish best served live, like Hamilton and Come From Away, seeing this event presentation feels like a good idea. The show is smoothly staged before an appreciative audience, with well-chosen theatrical touches.  This is Bareilles‚Äôs show in every way. While she doesn‚Äôt quite match the emotional subtlety of Jessie Mueller, who originated Jenna, she has grown in leaps and bounds as an actress and provides a warm anchor for the movie. ...combines the feeling of being in a Broadway audience with the advantages of a filmed performance that is preserved for posterity and can be viewed without buying a plane ticket to New York. This sweet story lends itself nicely to a musical... A lovely tribute to Adrienne Shelly. Most of the songs Bareillis wrote are upbeat, which matches the tone of the original Adrienne Shelly movie starring Keri Russell. When the music slows down for ballads, they are emotional and powerful. The film accomplishes its principal goal of capturing Sara Bareilles‚Äôs spectacular take on Jenna Hunterson, especially in its close-ups of the singer-songwriter. Bareilles...is splendid here, especially when delivering her Act 2 tour de force, ""She Used to Be Mine."" Sure, the show can be super-sugary and sentimental, but I was sold. And now I am hungry for pie. But even if the musical‚Äôs attempt to give back to the medium that birthed the source material is uneven, it accomplishes its main important goal: It will help more people see this wonderful piece of musical theater.","So good! Waitress has always been on my radar and I‚Äôve never been able to experience it live - this was honestly such a good alternative! Everything that I thought waitress was about, was that but so much better! Do watch it! Sara Bareilles is a brilliant songwriter and charismatic performer. She knows how to write a musical, too. Props. I just don't care for the plot...Hickville waitress doesn't want the baby she's having with her hillbilly husband whom she doesn't like or love. But, she bakes good pies... and salvation is created. Meh... Hmm, the best part was When He Sees Me but I think the whole story was a bit too dragging and some of the songs I didn't connect with for a musical. I would love to see a new Kimiko play focusing on Dawn's story and with more scenes like that of Ogie.  And maybe more with the When He Sees Me arrangement where audiences are reminded of each character's theme song just like how Hamilton did it. Absolutely brilliant from beginning to end. I loved the music already but if I'm honest couldn't imagine the musical movie being that great! The storyline was compelling, it was funny, poignant and superbly written. The singing was incredible. I have not felt this way about a movie OR a musical in so long, I LOVED IT. And will be watching it again. This story is such a candid protrayal of life and how we don't always get what we want. It just gives you everything: from funny and quirky moments to moments that will leave you sobbing. Everything from the music, to the performances and the camera work was really top notch! It really felt like watching a theatre show from the comfort of my home, so I'm really glad they kept that theatre essence in the movie. Not a show I've ever felt the need to see but absolutely loved this, emotional, heartfelt with pitch perfect performances What an amazing capture of an amazing show! Such a special, dynamic story brought to life seamlessly fluid on stage, with an extremely talented cast, Waitress is perfectly balanced and a must see for everyone. I fell in love with everything about this movie/show! The characters, the choreography, the music and the creative set. And the story!! I had no idea what I was in store for when I walked in the theater... Walked out with the same smile I had on my face the entire movie. See it. worst thing ive ever seen who was this made for Take the hint Broadway: we will pay to see the filmed versions, AND I promise we're not less likely to the live show (the opposite actually)... Even if you make us wait like with this one, it's worth it. Fantastic show! Some songs dont land the music is between okay and good. The main characters are very flawed, and there doesnt seem to be any consequences or resolution. The ending felt rushed and not realistic. I like the story but wish it was more fleshed out.

Maybe Im expecting more Lifetime network and less fun Musical?

(Review originally posted on Letterboxd) Love the mix of Broadway plus cinema! Music was good and the actors were great. Loved it! Saw it twice and it was great both times. Music, choreo, acting EVERYTHING was great! Great music! Relatable story. Great sets, singing, acting, one-liners. Absolutely glorious I loved this movie version of Waitress so much!  Really happy it was produced and I wish there would be more Broadway musicals we could view on film as it's not so easy to get to Broadway. Such amazing singing, acting in this musical. Best talent ... really takes your breath away. Loved the story, the music and the cast. We never got to see it on Broadway so we JUMPED at the chance to see it on the big screen. The very added bonus was seeing Sara Barellis in the role she originated   Thank you Fandango for once again bringing culture to the masses"
Comedy,chicken_run_dawn_of_the_nugget,"Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget ... feels like a referendum on children's animation, a call for well-crafted kids' movies built on compelling characters, smart themes, and actual jokes instead of cynical, synergistic products. This latest adventure is every bit as well-crafted, cleverly written, and stuffed with gallinaceous puns as its predecessor. Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget is a film that is very much about getting old, and that is perfect theme for a franchise the waited 23 years to come back. Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget is so passable in every way that it could be voiced entirely by one person, and it would still be entirely watchable. It won‚Äôt offend, surprise, or inspire in any way, but it isn‚Äôt boring, either.  The action element of the film has the enjoyable verve of the original, particularly when the mechanics of the nugget-maker are involved, but the lack of a tight focus on characters in one place makes the emotional heart of the matter more diffuse. [Dawn of the Nugget] does repeat some old hits, but it is a wacky, wild and ever so slightly scary follow-up, that has laughs and tail feather shaking delights over a rather pro-vegan story of trauma, freedom and family.  The rumours of Aardman‚Äôs demise ‚Äî the animation studio, not anyone with that surname ‚Äî have been somewhat exaggerated.  Aardman, founded over 50 years ago, is well known for its unique brand of good-natured British humor and expert stop-motion animation techniques. All of that is on display again in this fine sequel that is just as funny and engaging as the first one. Some of the simple beauty from more than two decades ago has been lost in the constant complexity and the busy nature of Nugget. Full of off-beat Aardman charm, this family adventure is a lot of fun. It‚Äôs pleasingly daft, very British and not exactly memorable. Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget only holds a fraction of what made the original animated feature great, while the rest is a disappointingly forgettable and unoriginal film. ""Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget"" serves up a tasty sequel. I enjoyed seeing the characters again but it's also highly forgettable and nothing I will remember going forward like the original film There are some fine new villains. The voice work rumbles with buttered-crumpet charm. Middle-ranking Aardman is better than almost anyone else on top form. This Netflix-financed romp blessedly preserves the original‚Äôs thumbprint-smeared, dad-joke-peppered charms and ignores recent trends toward bloodless kids‚Äô fare in favor of another jerry-rigged thrill ride. Dawn of the Nugget is a notable sequel to Aardman's gem. [Full review in Spanish] Though like most follow-ups it doesn‚Äôt quite match the fun of the original, ‚ÄúNugget‚Äù is an amusingly droll sequel that fans will enthusiastically welcome, especially after nearly a quarter-century wait.   There‚Äôs a goofy charm to the look and feel of the project that should delight animation fans, but this sequel lacks the playful inventiveness and breezy wit of the original.  ... Even a slightly half-baked Aardman conceit is better than most animated fare from the past year.","Chicken run dawn of the nugget is amazing aardman animated film from 2023 and my rating is a 10/10 Bad film that fits into modernity, it is not 1% as good as the first film, perhaps because the main audience has changed. CHICKEN RUN: DAWN OF THE NUGGET has a great title, an amusing and sinister premise, and plenty of pleasant British charms. Somehow though it seems to lack much of the special spark that made the first film so memorable---maybe simply because computer animated films have come such a long way since then, and stop-motion, while quirky and interesting, brings with it a certain pace that can feel a bit plodding. Great. I don't know what else to say. It's just great A worthy sequel despite a few flaws. It's safe to say that this movie is pretty good but not as good as the first Chicken Run movie. Sure, the animation is still great, but the thing is, I don't think Chicken Run needs a squeal but hey, it is my favorite stop-motion animated film franchise but that doesn't that I don't like it. 95/100 for good Amazing! I've waited so long for Chicken Run to have a sequel! The movie was awesome. Great claymation action with charming witty British humour, I loved it. Aardman Animation does it again! Not as good as the first one but still a good film. The truth is that although it does not surpass the first film, it is very good, it manages to work on its own, a shame that it is very underrated. Both Chicken Run movies are excellent. The Dawn of the Nugget is undoubtedly a worthy sequel to a worthy film. The story is excellent and does not leave behind the essence of the first. This film tries new and refreshing things. Bring brighter colors and new characters. Chicken Run 2:  Dawn of the Nugget is a film with great animation and a big delicious imagination. Highly recommended and enjoyable. Might be biased but the film was great! Not as great as the 1st probably a landslide but still was chrming enough to entertain me for 1hr 42minutes. I wish they bringed back the old voice actors and did better with marketing. In fact WHY DID THEY INTRODUCE MS.TWEEDY IN THE TRAILER this is the next aardman cinematic masterpiece! To be honest, I have mixed feelings about this movie. It pleased me in some areas and disappointed me in others. 

POV:

Pros: This movie did make me laugh at several parts and it contained some creative elements. I liked that the Chickens humorously infiltrate a heavily guarded farm that looks more like a military facility. Mission Impossible vibes at every turn. The writers brought back the classic villain Mellissa Tweedy, who was the antagonist in the first movie. I liked that the writers also introduced a new villain, Dr. Fry, who makes the film seem fresh and new. 

Believe it or not, the entire movie is stop-motion made, which brings a whole new level of appreciation for the work put in to make the movie. Stunning as always. 

Cons: Unfortunately, even with some good elements, there were several things in this movie that were disappointing. The character development of Rocky and Ginger's daughter, Molly, was quite poor. I wanted to like her character, but the writers gave her no likable or relatable qualities. Additionally, the dialogue between Molly and her parents was dull and flat, and almost seemed robotic. 

For the first part of the movie, the film seemed babyish and I honestly wanted to turn it off at several parts. I decided instead to continue watching because this was a long-anticipated second to the first Chicken Run movie. As the movie progressed it got more interesting and the quality of the jokes improved, however, there were several occasions when I cringed because of the simply poor writing. 

Final verdict: While I was impressed with some parts of the movie, I was disappointed at the quality of the writing at times. Then again, one can't expect much from movies these days, so in that case this film was on the better side. Three stars. It isn't terrible but I am not entirely sure why this exists. After rewatching this movie, it was so much worse than I thought. Just a genuine question: Why would anyone watch this movie when it's nearly the same plot as the first one except this time they're breaking in? Now I'm not gonna explain every negative but I will explain the ones that bugged me the most.
The plot is pretty much the equivalent to The Little Mermaid 2. Molly wants to go to the other side but Ginger refuses cause of what happened in the last movie and doesn't bother to explain why. Not to mention that Rocky is also responsible for telling Molly about his ""Loan Free Ranger"" days which motivates her to go out and explore. So then Molly meets another chicken named Frizzle and gets transported to Fun Land Farms. Speaking of which, the original Chicken Run was supposed to take place around the early 1940's and this movie is supposed to take place at least 8+ years after the original. So do you honestly expect me to believe that they would have such advanced technology in the 50's?
Most of the characters are just bad compared to the original. Ginger has been reduced to an overprotective mother and has been mercilessly character assassinated. There was one moment in the movie that completely goes against her motives from the original. Rocky has been reduced to a punching bag throughout the entire movie. I'm just sick of sequels treating their old characters like trash in order for the new ones to shine. Molly is just not that interesting of a character. Frizzle is completely wasted due to her being mind controlled for a good chunk of the movie. Fowler has now been one noted to talking to a snail for a big chunk of the movie and adds nothing to the plot. But then there's Mrs. Tweedy‚Ä¶ For starters they never explain how she survived almost being boiled alive by gravy and crushed by a door in the last movie. Second of all her motives are pin point identical to the last movie aka ""Running an evil food business for her own needs"". And finally she's just not as cool as she was in the original. They even repeat the ""Bye Bye"" scene except it's just lame and not as satisfying.
The only good or at least decent characters in this movie were Babs, Nick, Fletcher and Dr Fry. Babs pretty much stayed the same and is actually more funny in this movie with her having more jokes. Nick and Fletcher were alright and Dr Fry is a decent equivalent to Mr. Tweedy. 
Just like with most bad sequels there are way too many conveniences and contrivances that get characters out of trouble. Like the sun light being exactly where it needed to be to light the firework and the missing string so Molly could escape the room.
The climax is just lame compared to the pie machine scene and the plane climax from the original.
The only redeeming factors of this movie is the brilliant stop motion animation, a few funny jokes, the ""My Sweet Baby"" song, whenever Babs is on screen and a couple decent scenes.
But like I said, this movie is still awful. It's just a shame since Aardman has made a lot of amazing movies so I guess you could call Dawn of the Nugget their first bad movie. Just go watch the original instead. It's not as good as the first movie, but it works. It feels like watching Impossible Mission with chickens. Silly but enjoyable. Mid/meh, very tedious and standard. Utterly forgettable, unfunny, none of the original voice actors, writing that felt lifted from virtually any other kids movie you could name with this kind of formula and certainly nothing like the original's culture or language. It's obvious this was churned out of the Hollywood machine, and I gave up after about 25 minutes. I felt condescended, bored, and only a bit disappointed as I got what I expected. Good movies are over. Strong writing and risks have been replaced with formula, and audiences are deeply sick of it. 8.2/10
I love the original Chicken Run and was happy to hear we were finally getting a sequel! Did Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget do its predecessor justice? Definitely! I throughly enjoyed this sequel more than I expected to! The plot was funny and great, the Aardman claymation looks fantastic, and the new voice cast nail their roles, Bella Ramsey was a nice choice! The only problem I want to bring up is how the villain, Ms. Tweedy looks younger than her in the first movie, I don't know if that's just me. All in all, Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget is an entertaining and acceptable sequel with funny jokes, sweet claymation, and a great plot for the whole family!"
