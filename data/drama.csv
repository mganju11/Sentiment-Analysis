Drama,four_daughters_2023,"Four Daughters is a story about a family torn apart by religious extremism and institutional misogyny. It's also about our inability to control the lives of those around us, even if it means losing them forever. The intersplicing between documentarian interviews and recreations of the past via actors may seem an odd choice at first, but this decision enhances the emotional earnestness of the subject. As Rahma and Ghofrane look for ways to rebel and embrace a morbid fundamentalism, Ben Hania’s film gradually transforms into a horror film, specifically demonic possession, but nothing supernatural is afoot. The only evil is a cycle of abuse  A docudrama with a lovely way of blending real-life participants with actors, but its story of two teenage girls who escaped a disturbing and abusive homelife with their mother, is less successful in offering broader insight into why women joined IS A compelling, touching story of memory and generational trauma, it’s a heartbreaking roadmap to radicalization marked with a family’s despair. We see the power in tying together the fake and the real — the moment when method acting turns into method remembering. It is not the first time that fictional reenactment has been employed in a documentary, but Kaouther Ben Hania takes it to very particular and contradictory levels in some scenes... in others, it is fascinating and moving. [Full review in Spanish] An impactful movie that layers documentary elements with dramatic acting to make a film within a film. By using some of the real-life people in the re-enactments, it's both an examination and cinematic therapy of a family's love and painful fracturing. As with Joshua Oppenheimer’s The Act of Killing (2012), the staging of scenes with people who lived through those events becomes an engrossing platform through which subject, performer, and audience can comprehend. It's a kind of heartbreaking story of families being torn apart by hard-line religious dogma. Kaouther Ben Hania blends re-enactments using actors with the real-life family in a bid to unravel how half of this funny, warm, strong-willed quartet of feisty, smart, siblings went from heavy metal fans to wearing the niqab and joining Islamic State. Admittedly during rehearsals some deeper biographical insights are gleaned, but they come at a cost to the film’s narrative and intellectual clarity. [Kaouther Ben Hania's] technique could have made for purely formal game-playing: instead, the artifice casts a sharp magnifying gaze on real family agony and, against the odds, occasional joy. A morbidly fascinating, morally murky but seemingly freeing window into how one family processes generational trauma. The ambition found here certainly makes for a compelling experience filled with rich details concerning resilient yet tortured individuals. Four Daughters blends truth and fiction with rare transparency, and does it for a purpose. You won't see another film quite like it this year, or really any year. The Four Daughters ends up being devastating due to its content, and while its form makes it transcend and be interesting, it is not exempt from potential dissent or controversy. [Full review in Spanish] In documenting the Islamic radicalization which splits apart a family, Ben Hania’s film becomes something of a therapy session but “Four Daughters” is also often a joyous occasion of recollections, laughter and love.   The result is a work, despite its apparent complexity, that is simply crystalline. [Full review in Spanish] The new Arab cinema looks at bad women like her [the mother], as a simple link manipulated by even worse men. [Full review in Spanish]","An emotionally powerful documentary. The idea of reenacting some scenes with actresses to play the two missing daughters soon breaks down, and the best parts of the film involves the mom and real daughters just talking to the actresses. A harrowing Arabic-language documentary and drama, Four Daughters is about four daughters and a mother whose sees her two oldest daughters leave to Syria. I knew nothing and it is a little different as actresses fill the void of the missing talking heads. I'm not sure it totally worked for me. This is a scary tale with many tentacles.  It doesn't always make for a great film, but it is most certainly an intriguing one. Probably the best therapy for the family torn apart by hard-line religious dogma. Final Score: 7/10 Fascinating story that you have unlikely seen before. Uma história para mim muito surpreendente. Eu jamais imaginaria que esse tipo de coisa estivesse acontecendo. Adolescentes criadas com hábitos ocidentais rebelando-se e escolhendo uma vida ultraconservadora que as leva a crimes terríveis... Depois fui pesquisar e descobri que o aliciamento está ocorrendo no mundo inteiro. Esse documentário é um importante alerta para famílias de adolescentes. Odd setup here with the mix of actors and the actual family, blending live interviews and reenactments. I'm not sure it works. It's a little meta, and on the plus side, in some ways it might actually help demonstrate some of the lived pain of the girls. There are some highly emotional scenes right from the get-go, and I definitely wasn't immune to sympathizing with what this family has gone through.

But, was it just me or is this movie extraordinarily incriminating of the mom? She is pretty hard to like and seems easy to blame for contributing to her daughters' attraction to extremism, but regardless, it's not hard to connect with her pain and loss and regret. And maybe I'd connect even more with it all and have more understanding if I was a mother or a daughter. There definitely could be a big blind spot here for me in that regard. The mother-daughter dynamic happening in the midst of a lot of other poignant themes like abuse, religion, and conservatism.

In the end, I thought there would be a bigger payoff, some bigger moments to finalize the story. And I think the material was there, but tone-wise it sort of builds to a plateau. Really impressive, impactful documentary!  Using actors for the two missing sisters and subbing in actors for additional scenes, the documentary allows Olfa and her daughters to explain their story through words and scenes.  Worth watching!  4 stars I only watched this movie because it was nominated for an Academy Award.

The story was unbelievable, I saw a mother Olfa a bully as who someone wanted her two youngest daughters to actresses.  The two older girls just wanted freedom from strict and abusive mother. A most remarkable and moving film. The story of this family would be interesting enough, but the way the film has been structured is unlike anything I have seen before.   Beautifully photographed, exquisitely acted and bravely re-lived. I was totally engrossed and it was a rare window into a world previously closed to me.
That laughter, songs and joy can coexist with such trauma is a testament to the human spirit.  Bravo to all involved in this production. It is a moving portrait of a family in a world influenced by currents... The film has a form that is bold and online any other... i thought it was boring and long  and dreary- saw other Middle Eastern movies at the Palm Springs International Film Festival where it was also playing and found them all - Inshallah, a boy Bye bye Tiberias , Memories(?) all much more interesting Played out in a unique documentary style I have not seen before, this story develops in a way that fills in all the cracks and crevasses not normally explored.  You will come away with a better understanding of what can drive people to do things that seem unimaginable to the average person.  It can feel slow moving at times, but its pace is used to the story’s benefit, giving the viewer the time and ability to fully feel and comprehend the emotional twists and turns. A must see for mothers, especially if they have daughters. A story that takes place between reality and reenactment, between historical records and memories, between takes and backstage talks. A story about ways to cope and overcome generational trauma. A story where the actors involved start by explaining that they have ways to be detached from the roles they play, but end by being so affected by them that they can't continue playing. A story that seemed to me so foreign, yet so close to home. You need to experience it to understand. Compelling and educational. This movie went beyond entertainment and I came away with a deeper understanding of another culture. Touching, funny, genuine, intimate, thought provoking.
I had assumptions when I started watching the movie.
I was concerned I was embarking on a self-contemplative and depressing director's diary of filming a documentary, which would slip into a making-of…
My assumptions were wrong.
Dropped them in the first 10 minutes. very disappointed with this going on my worst movie ive watched all year list The most compelling documentary of 2023. Stunning filmmaking which brings nuance and personal insights into the dynamics of a single Tunisian mother raising four daughters, two whom go missing. Ce film est absolument brillant. Tant dans la forme que dans le fond. Une réalisation inspirate. Et un témoignage sans égal de la situation des femmes musulmanes en Tunisie. J'ai pleuré, souris, ris. Une chose est sûre, ces femmes sont magnifiques tant elles nous ouvrent les portes de leurs vies.."
Drama,the_taste_of_things,"The Taste of Things unfolds at a slow simmer, with deliciously tender results. [Full review in Spanish] Trần Anh Hùng has cooked up a spectacular film that takes its time, placing the central relationship on a gentle simmer... The Taste of Things is romantic. It’s tragic. It’s simply magnifique. Binoche and Magimel believably communicate their affection for the work they do and for each other, which should leave a distinctly warm taste in audiences’ mouths. The movie absorbs us with its almost dialogue-free scenes and with the music created by the simple sound of kitchen utensils. [Full review in Spanish] The film is not just about the taste of food, but of love, beauty, sensuality, and human connection, offering a deeply gratifying viewing experience. Music would be superfluous in this symphony of touch and taste and unhurried heaven. The sound is the pulse of the process, of intense labor turned to immediate, sense-simmering result. Those who prefer dialogue or action-driven cinematic fare may find this not their Taste, but if you’re in the mood for slow-cooked (and most-assuredly not half-baked) drama with all the visually arresting trimmings, this offers a nourishing narrative. It's completely wonderful and is also that rare movie that you enter into fully. By the end, the vast stone kitchen is as familiar as home.  A delectable, sumptuous waltz around the kitchen that is nostalgic yet powerfully contemporary, focussing on the timeless things in life that really matter The kitchen is the engine room of this film. Occasionally the action may stray into the garden or the bedchamber, but almost every scene, and every relationship seems to revolve around the oven. “The Taste of Things” is a movie meant to make you fall in love — with the food, with the stars, with the French countryside — and it succeeds beautifully. The Taste of Things is a patient film but it’s bubbling with intensity and a great lust for the love of food and the sensuality of a lover. The Taste of Things is a sensual delight.  This in an Epicurean epic about loving food, loving cooking and loving doing so for someone you love. There's nothing wrong with that but whether it needs to be served over eight courses is another question. The tantrums and theatricality attached to the cult of the celebrity chef are enough to kill my appetite, but I found an antidote in The Taste of Things. It is a slight affair, to be sure, but it certainly hits the mark as a foodie film. On its own terms, considering what Tran is aiming to create and what he has achieved, it is a masterful work of cinema. I believe its target audience will find it utterly entrancing. With Juliette Binoche at the stove, every dish is a star in this dreamy, 19th-century romance. Lovers of great food on film had better cancel all other reservations and take a seat at the table of this sumptuous visual feast.  “The Taste of Things” is a sumptuous, nuanced, and gorgeous portrait of love that delights with every frame. ","Absolutely glorious, an epicurean love story, meandering, slow but purposeful - definitely a critics film - won't be for everyone. It was a immensely beautiful film. I was entranced the entire time. I loved it!! Long and slow moving, with a very thin and stretched out story interspersed between large sections of cooking, eating and discussions about food. The film begins with a 20 minute sequence where the characters calmly and quietly cook an entire meal with minimal dialogue. It is very artistic and sensual, with focus on the visuals and sounds. The film makers turn up the volume on the sound of food being chopped, chewed in the mouth, and the chef’s disturbingly heavy breathing which sounds as though he would suffocate in his sleep. In short, it was completely boring. Based on Dodin-Bouffant, created by Swiss author Marcel Rouff in his 1924 novel La Vie et la passion de Dodin-Bouffant, gourmet (The Passionate Epicure), Trần Anh Hùng's French submission for the Academy Award for Best International Feature simmers with epicurean delights as a love story of the gourmand and his culinarian with the French haute cuisine they prepare as their language of love. Simply put, a beautiful movie. La réalisation et le jeu des acteurs est impeccable. Le film est une ode à la tradition culinaire française, durant lequel sont concoctés une liste fournie de plat emblématiques. En toile de fond la relation entre Dodin et sa cuisinière est plutôt classique.
Au final, on passe un moment qui n'est pas désagréable avec une belle esthétique, mais c'est un peu tout. The lightning, the cinematography, the sounds & images of the food and the cooking. All great. Good film with not much of a story, but focused on the kitchen totally, with some kind of a love story around it Beautiful cinematography, but weird sound effects (the sound of strong wind, and not a leaf moving in the garden). The most boring movie I have seen living memory, and just so looooong. Very slow ,and at times boring . The Taste of Things is a beautiful ode to food and the cooking of. It's a feast for the eyes, in many ways, a sumptuous and delicious film. Set on a French country estate in 1889, it features Dodin, a gourmand, and Eugenie, a cook who works for him. They have been in partnership for 20 years and also have a romantic relationship. But they have never married and sleep in separate rooms. The film opens with both preparing an elaborate meal for a group of Dodin's friends. It's a long extended sequence of food preparation as we view the love and dedication involved. Dodin and Eugenie spend countless hours discussing food and the inherent beauty with in. This film takes its time, the camera moves slowly around long scenes of cooking, eating and conversation. It's infused with light, focusing on the beautiful food made. It's beautifully acted too, with Juliette Binoche and Benoit Magimel superb in the lead roles. Nineteenth century France saw the burgeoning of gourmet restaurants and this wonderful film shows the beginning of that movement with a fair amount of grace and beauty. The most boring movie I ever saw. There is no plot and no talking except once in while when they tell you a boring fact about some old restaurant or meal. Very pretentious and I would have walked out if I wasn’t with a friend I don’t see very often. Slow, deliberate-- a love story about food and passion. So good, I left hungry. Fantastic acting. Parts a bit slow Beautifully filmed and mouth-watering to watch. With Chef Pierre Gagniere culinary direction, we are served with an exquisite, mouth watering film that  comes alive when the cooking and savoring are being displayed with great panache and artistry that the French are famous for. Beautifully choreographed and shot by Tran Anh Hung and his cinematographer Jonathan Ricquebourg. The only drawback, despite Juliette Binoche and Benoît Magimel palpable chemistry, is the lack of a story. could have used a little more plot, but regardless… delicious to watch. Don't eat BEFORE watching this movie. Select a place afterwards and thoughtfully. A beautiful French kitchen, beautifully prepared dishes, and a love story spanning 20 years. I couldn't have asked for more. ❤️❤️ Beautifully done film. It is slow-moving and very food-focused, so be sure to keep that in mind if those qualities don't appeal to you. I loved it. The acting is terrific, and the relationships are well-crafted and lovingly developed. I found the making of the food, especially on the 19th century equipment, to be mesmerizing and hunger inducing. I think it may take a few screenings to soak in everything that The Taste of Things has to offer, but Tran Anh Hung has put together a singular viewing experience that I can't wait to return to. Boasting its fair share of delicious imagery and culinary procedural moments, the movie depicts a decades-long romance between Benoît Magimel and Juliette Binoche.
Full Review: https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/the-taste-of-things-movie-2023/ I’m a former professional chef and restaurant owner and this film is fantastic!  I love everything about it! Food, love and dead… what’s else do you want on a movie..? Great! Highly recommend! Also I highly recommend you to bring some delicious food to eat while you’re watching it because I guarantee you will be hungry!! Bon appetite!!"
Drama,killers_of_the_flower_moon,"Its compassion for groups like the Osage Nation is matched only by its condemnation of greedy values and selfish ambitions at the expense of others. By its final act, when you’ve journeyed through some of its most inspired filmmaking homages, one thing remains clear: “Killers of the Flower Moon” is really a horror film. Scorsese’s effort is outstanding across the board, from his methodical direction to his heartrendingly honest truths about the American Dream.  For three and a half hours, Scorsese immerses us in these acts, and he doesn’t allow us to look away. He refuses us the catharsis of justice, because history provides none. The tone may be ""mournful,"" but it's scattered over 3 hours and 26 minutes. That's napful. While the pacing could never be called snappy, the film is still captivating, plunging audiences into a time so different from our own and then compelling them to stay.  In the hands of any filmmaker, other than Scorsese, Mollie and her family would've turned into fleeting images covered in dust with the focus shifting towards how the crimes occurred and how far they went. Problem is .. I can't decide which I prefer! Killers of the Flower Moon is, for such a dramatic and dark film, wildly entertaining throughout its epic runtime. Martin Scorsese's masterpiece is an epic of love, oil, and betrayal among the Osage. “Killers of the Flower Moon” is just another Scorsese gangster film in social conscious drag. On those terms, it is a sublime, unrelenting film that mines the humor from a grim situation and nails the period in a way that no other film has.  For all of the energy [Scorsese] invests in honoring the First Peoples by revealing how they were deceived and slaughtered, his fascination with the depravity of powerful men still seems the subject he’s most excited about dramatizing. There’s acting and there’s existing in a realm as a performer. Lily Gladstone exists as Mollie Burkhart. She downplays the act, she breathes through the character, patiently waits, exerts power, and navigates a hostile world... Lily Gladston's performance is the only reason to see this movie.

""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a grueling, punishing experience to sit through.

Anyone with a half a brain could edit an hour out of this movie, blindfolded. That it remains riveting and accessible despite the gravity of the subject matter is a testament to Scorsese's storytelling moxie, a lived-in screenplay credited to the director and Eric Roth, and Thelma Schoonmaker... Gladstone’s performance is unlike anything else in Scorsese’s work. Terrible things have indeed occurred throughout history. Are we doing anything to change that in the future? Or are we simply devouring their pain greedily? While Killers of the Flower Moon is a reflection of the incessant need to document suffering through a white lens, reluctance to commit to the very real and ongoing pain, Lily Gladstone, the Indigenous cast, as well as the Osage Nation, shines brightest. Killers of the Flower Moon’s 'Greenbook' approach to the Osage murders, misses a crucial perspective. While Lily Gladstone shines, the film's angle disappoints. You have to admire a filmmaker that makes a piece of art that means something to them and does it their way regardless of the commercial issues and does it through a company where most of their content is seen at home. Killers of the Flower Moon is not so much a whodunnit as a whydunnit: a penetrating exploration of hubris and fall, of trust and betrayal, of evil, sin and greed.","Impeccably made, with masterful direction from a seasoned director, giving us the impression that decades of learning, growing, and mastering his craft can provide us a monumental, sprawling, 3+hrs epic that feels more like it's 2hrs and a bit long, with plenty to soak in, and plenty to reward a return to the film over time. Whilst there is a deft approach to treating the osage culture with the harsh realism of what they faced at the time, there is something vacant, a slight void, perhaps the actual scale of the murders themselves felt a little downplayed. Nonetheless, a must-watch. Deniro was great.  Leonardo was good.  Other actors were good.  Jessie was assume as usual.  It was just too damn long! Cancel your appointments, turn off your phone, stock up on food and water, you're going to be here for a while. An immersive film that is worth the length.  Well paced with great acting.  Movies like this are rare these days. Retrata triste e lindamente o Massacre da Tribo Osage, os indígenas mais ricos das Américas, devido ao Petróleo em suas terras, a ambição humana desmedida e maligna… Produção fantástica, um roteiro apaixonante, apesar das 3h e pouca (que eu sempre assisto numa velocidade aceleradinha para acompanhar meu ritmo), o filme flui lindamente, que tampouco percebemos sua longa durabilidade… O desfecho real foi ainda mais triste, os larápios pegaram pena curta e viveram muito, no ostracismo, Mollie tb... This is a great movie but it is very slow placed and detailed. I enjoyed it and felt the acting from DiCaprio and De Niro was spot on. Martin Scorsese wanted to do the story justice, and I believe he did that. This might be unpopular opinion, but I think this would have made a better two part movie or perhaps a series on Apple TV. I enjoyed it, but at times, it was hard to stay focused and sit still when such a long run time. If you watch it in theaters, you have to prepare yourself. Definitely worth a watch, however, if you struggle with long movies, maybe wait for streaming. *slight spoliers*
Another brilliant memorable flick from Scorsese, the director really does not know how to do mediocrity. De Niro is fantastic as always and his portrayal as the sociopathic calculated William Hale ranks as one of his most despicable characters in his acting career.
Leonardo also plays the ever pliable Ernest well. 

It’s a long runtime but it never gets dull, I feel the 3 hour plus runtime was justified as it immerses you into the story well. It is a very melancholy film, it’s terrible what some humans will do to one another in the name of greed. A masterpiece of a film that would probably sit in the number 1 spot for films I’ve seen this year. Good film from beginning to end, I still personally like some of his other movies more though. Scorsese is the best biopic director ever, I truly think so. I hated nearly every character in this film The ending is simply one of the best cinema I’ve seen. This movie is a must watch Not as impressed as I thought I might be with the movie, especially after reading the book and being very impressed with it. This is indeed a tragic story and obviously a little known tragic story, but people go to the movies to be entertained so it's hard to think of this as entertainment. It's almost like a forced history lesson. I thought it was too long and belabored. The level of corruption and evil it took to systematically defraud and murder on the part of all of those involved is almost unbelievable. Martin Scorcese's heart is in the right place in bringing the book to light but I don't know that it got the job done. I have been waiting almost a year to watch this film.  Still only available to purchase a digital copy for 24.99 cad, which they can take from you as they feel like.   I want to rent. I don't want to buy.  It was released last year.  The GREED OF APPLE IS WILD.   Guess I'll be pirating.  Thx. Based on a true story, Scorsese’s latest outing tells the tale of a 1920’s Oklahoma family that tries to “inherit” Osage Indian land by marrying the landowners and then murdering them. This was news to me, but yeah, that really happened. Apparently, something like 60 Osage Indians were murdered over the course of a decade in these schemes, leading the U.S. Government to change laws regarding inheritance of Native American land. Unfortunately, the film is just too damn long. Clocking in at three and a half hours, it takes an interesting premise and just drags it out to the point of being boring. This seems to be an unexpected consequence of the streaming era. In the old days, studios were a lot more demanding with filmmakers when it came to runtime. This ensured they could get as many daily showings in a cinema as possible. With more viewers waiting to stream films, runtime seems to be less important to studios, allowing filmmakers to indulge to the detriment of their own films. Leaving an hour of this one on the cutting room floor would have benefited this film immensely. Anyone giving this film a high rating is pretentious and doesn't know good entertainment Speechless but not in a good way. The brutal story of how the Natives were victims of American colonialism and genocide needs to be told. However, I do not think this film did it justice. While it showed how truly awful people can be, well that’s all it shows. Only in the last 5 minutes showed the resilience of Osage people. The rest of the film is them getting gruesomely murdered, swindled, and being bred/married for money and to be ethnically cleansed/killed by their spouses. All the characters were truly one-dimensional with De Niro being as solely heinous and egomaniacal as the devil himself, and DiCaprio being very seemingly stupid and having no redeeming qualities. [SPOILERS AHEAD] 
…
He goes along with and participates without needing much coercion from De Niro. He seemingly never has a moral dilemma to be honest to his wife or at least not POISON her. Sure he acted sweet in front of her while behind her back he was committing evil acts but to me it makes him less likable. Not only is he a murderous thief, he pretends to be a sweet loving husband while killing her family. The gratification of seeing justice to the bad guys is overshadowed by the long run time and unfortunately is not gratifying at all. We see Lily Gladstone’s character finally show some resistance to DiCaprio in the very end, and I like how she just walked away with poise, it was true to her character, but honestly she deserved much more. I cannot believe she didn’t kill him in that field but embraced him. There was no way she did not know he was guilty at that point. Particularly because she was well enough to meet him in the field. I know “rose colored glasses” but he was never that great of a husband and he killed your family and tried to kill you. She knew this I believe, otherwise that would make her very ignorant. She is the ultimate victim who loses truly everything. We only hope her life after this was peaceful, but we don’t know for sure. All we get is a obituary. We don’t know what became of the Osage people or how they fought back. Or how we could support indigenous people today Great cast, superb story telling. This is an important story, and it will certainly reach a wider audience as a DiCaprio film than as a documentary. That said, it's not the kind of movie you want to reach for unless you're in the mood to be mad about real life injustices. Read the book first. I was disappointed in the movie. They spend so much time on all the murders, that they skipped over the FBI portion. The murders were important but so was the investigation. Very slow. Scorsese did a nice job with the scenery/set but this movie did not live up to the hype of his previous movies. Waiting for the next Scorcese film which is always a must see. I actually feel asleep in the cinema."
Drama,our_son,"Our Son is populated by good, well-meaning people navigating a difficult, but necessary change. It’s not profound or particularly original, but its universality is its strong point.  Serious, sober and sensibly intense, this is an unfrivolous and restrained drama that doesn’t quite have the emotive gut-punch that you might expect for a film about a broken home. “Our Son” is a definitely a gay movie by, for, and about adults; and the rarity of this makes it essential viewing. Porter is fantastic, but the film really belongs to Evans, who is hugely affecting as the busy working man struggling to figure out how to be a father. All the characters are rounded, fallible and likable in equal measure, and even if the score is a bit syrupy, it’s a pleasant, engaging watch. Evans and Porter’s phenomenal performances ensure that viewers feel every blow of their custody battle. A groundbreaking drama full of emotional resonance and representation from two openly gay leads. While this New York City-set divorce drama offers enough modern tweaks on a well-worn narrative, its emotional resonance remains elusive, muted even The slick results will resonate for some, but they felt artificial to me. As a director, Bill Oliver never allows this to be overly melodramatic with blow out, rage fueled fights. Luke Evans and Billy Porter are keen to keep everything as grounded as possible...both give terrific performances. The performances are excellent and despite some moderate contrivances, the compassion for kids and adults alike involved feels more heartfelt than forced. Our Son is a heartfelt drama with strong acting at its core from Luke Evans and Billy Porter. A simple yet engaging melodrama... This is a universal story, made more universal when seen from a different angle. “Sweet” and “sensitive” may win the day. But this fight over “Our Son” is a little bland and predigested A beautifully judged human drama that dissects a dying marriage with humor and intelligence, drawing out an especially open and moving performance from Porter. There’s plenty of lovely little moments here. And while Oliver and Peter Nickowitz’s screenplay plays a tad derivative in places, performances are top-notch.  Nothing gels until the 45-minute mark. That’s when the reality of divorce, separating and child custody issue sinks in... Anger, bitterness, sorrow and longing ensue, and the film finds its footing. A cathartically devastating film, Our Son reaches deep into the wells of emotion, delivering a well-constructed breakdown of love on the shoulders of two actors at the top of their game.  Our Son might get some comparisons to Kramer vs. Kramer because of the many similarities, but Our Son is more like a made-for-TV movie instead of an Oscar-worthy film. The convincing performances elevate this formulaic divorce drama when the pacing drags.","This was a well-acted movie and I am glad it exists for representation and that I saw it. Gabriel was a rather unsympathetic and selfish character, however, and the song during the credits was awful.  The supporting cast, including Andrew Ranells, Phylicia Rashad and Kate Burton, was a highlight of the film. A compelling and very contemporary story told beautifully. Excellent performances, wonderful cinematography, fantastic direction. Started out as a queer turn of “Kramer vs. Kramer” till it’s gotten remarkably deeper with mesmerizing drama and passionate vision uplifted by the main pair’s respective tour-de-force performances. (B+) Top notch cast ! Bitttersweet but engaging storyline , definitely an issue of our times . Well worth the watch . I was pretty engaged. Afterwards I thought ""I've seen this story before."" Maybe I've seen Billy Porter on too many talk shows being ""fierce,"" but the performance left a bad taste in my mouth. Seriously good queer family drama with a fantastic and inspiring cast. Our Son is a 2023 American crime drama film directed by Bill Oliver 👦🏻 

Meh, it passed the time. 
Just. 😐
👍🏼👎🏼

When his husband Gabriel files for divorce, Nicky fights for custody of their 8-year-old son Owen, as he struggles to come to terms with what it means to love someone and what it means to be a father. Amazing! That is all that needs to be said! Deft performances throughout.  Phylicia Rashad especially.  Great story and wonderfully portrayed. Contrived and boring. Both actors are good but seem amateurish in this awful movie. ""Our Son"" is a testament to the power of storytelling. The screenplay's emotional intelligence is coupled with amazing performances by Billy Porter and Luke Evans who relay the complexity of relationships and the fragility of love. It is easy to see how the movie balances the moments of raw tension and impassioned depth. Bravo! Get through this first scene. I almost shut it off. Thankful I didn't. There is so much to gain from watching the struggle of this family. Well written. I was skeptical going into watching this film. Does the world really need another divorce/custody drama?  But this was a really good film with a unique perspective and a seriously talented cast. As a divorced man, this was a hard watch for me and brought back a lot of painful memories.  That being said, it's truly an amazing movie with some great characters brought to life by a stellar cast. Excellent performances and direction. i would highly recommend this film. Great music too. It's about time someone made a movie about divorce from a new perspective!  Can't believe how good Billy Porter and Luke Evans are together.  Great supporting cast as well. Two parents who contributed to a marriage but along the way the child got lost.
Still heartfelt and some very good performances.
If only the outcome could be a moderately successful.

worth watching This is by far the best movie that I have seen all year! I saw this in the theater in LA. It was a beautiful movie. I definitely recommend it. This film lives up to the hype. Very good movie."
Drama,priscilla,"There was a void, endless and dark, in the comfort of Priscilla's existence. As well as love, disturbingly abusive yet enduring. And Sofia Coppola nailed all that queasy glamour and somnambulic psychosexual malaise to a tee. A tender, poignant drama and an excellent continuation of her muted but no less intoxicating style. It shows Coppola at her most understanding as she presents a complex, multi-faceted love story where two lovers drift apart. Graceland has long since been shrouded in a gauzy, almost impenetrable mythology, making it difficult to access the people who resided within it. Sofia Coppola manages to pierce through and let the darkness inside seep out. This flaw is what ultimately prevents her from telling Priscilla Presley's story more effectively... In Sofia Coppola’s Cinema of Girlhood, Priscilla is a horror movie. From Lost in Translation to Marie Antoinette to Somewhere, Coppola keeps returning to lonely young women who see beauty in the world that others miss. In Priscilla, she has found her perfect subject. Spaeny, convincingly playing a 14-year-old dressed up to look 24, and respectfully adored by cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd, is so magnetic in every scene of Priscilla that even Jacob Elordi’s Elvis almost dissolves when she’s onscreen beside her. Coppola’s anti-fairytale was doused in perfume and pink wallpaper to zoom in on a woman at the heart of manipulation, gaslighting, grooming, and possessive love. But it works, a great companion piece to Coppola’s filmography... It’s an exquisitely calibrated piece of filmmaking, at once dreamy, melancholy and threaded with quiet power. A bubble-bursting biopic [...] that melts the myth of Elvis. Priscilla is an engaging and moody memoir-biopic... And true to Coppola’s signature form, it’s an engrossing watch with a score and soundtrack that remains evocative because it doesn’t feature the “King”’s music. This time we get Priscilla's point of view. The bulk of the film is devoted to the confusions and uncertainties of an immature girl who meets the world’s most famous pop star when she is only fourteen, and finds herself the object of a strange, chaste courtship. It occurs to me that this supposedly romantic story sometimes feels like a horror story. [Full review in Spanish] The filmmaker seems to have been born to tell the story of a woman trapped between glamor and loneliness; this story fits like a glove in all her filmography's obsessions... [Full review in Spanish] The life of Priscilla Presley as told by Sofia Coppola is a journey of liberation and empowerment, a portrait that focuses on the part of the story that was never properly told. [Full review in Spanish]  The film does more to damn Elvis the man by denying the audience any glimpse of Elvis the icon. Despite a brilliant performance from its two leads Priscilla is still slightly disappointing. The screenplay leaves the audience asking more questions than are answered. Beautifully shot and moody, it often feels more like a fashion project than a character-driven piece. Coppola, Spaeny, Elordi — with long-time cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd (The Beguiled) and editor Sarah Flack (Lost in Translation) — have found a way to tell this story that is as unsparing as it is sympathetic. Bravo.","I liked the soundtrack, but ultimately got bored after an hour. I understand why the film was made; Priscilla deserved better. This was a sad, dull & unfulfilling film that (based on what I’ve read) has been very selective on content and may have been a little too team Priscilla. only worth watching for the costume design. baz lurmans elvis with austin butler and tom hanks was better than this good film but very very slow and pricilla was great but i didnt like the dude who portrayed elvis very slow film great costumes it was interesting it focused on elvis relationships and infidelities. worth watching once A decent biopic about the wife of Elvis Presley and her relationship with the Legend himself......not sure what was the total point other than to show he wasn't an Angel, but still worth a watch non the less. A film that's extremely well made, and has some really great acting, but unfortunately failed to take a stand concerning it's subject matter and therefore doesn't really end up saying anything. Not bad but not good, not boring but pointless. This is what happens when an amazing director writes a mediocre script. Wow yet another money grab and change of story by priscilla its clear to see why this caused issues with Lisa Marie before she passed. Considering Priscilla has already wrote a book and had a movie off ""Elvis and me "" years ago this just seems dishonest.
Besides that the movie was very slow and the casting poor.
I wouldn't bother with this one when there's good Elvis Movies out there. Nothing new. It was just the way Elvis was. She was treated terrible. An intensely boring film. Approximately two hours of drudgery can be summed up with: Elvis and Priscilla sit in dark rooms while Elvis mumbles, Elvis and Priscilla sit in dark rooms and take pills, Elvis goes to film movies, Priscilla sits in dark rooms and talks to Elvis on the phone, Elvis and Priscilla ignore their child. End film. Well directed and Spaeny gives a great performance as a girl being groomed under the thumb of this controlling version of Elvis. Unfortunately, after the first 30 minutes its all just the same beats over and over again for the rest of the movie. This was a better movie than I expected overall, and it was nice to see a film as a contrast to the previously released Elvis film. 

Although I was not fond of the actor who played Elvis and did not find him wholly convincing, it was interesting to see a darker side to things and to not see him painted in some odd sainthood or worship.

The whole relationship between them is definitely unnerving, and I still cannot quite fathom what her parents were thinking. Different time I guess, but still. Eye Opening! A film that looks like it was chopped up! The film goes on and on and on, but it always lands in the same place I finally got to see this movie on an airplane yesterday, and I really enjoyed it. (I also enjoyed it a lot more than the Elvis film, despite the fact that Austin Butler delivered such a strong performance, and I have enjoyed less biographical Baz Luhrman films in the past.) 

This film gave me everything I've come to expect and love in a Sofia Coppola film: Beautiful cinematography, moments of poetic angst, a great soundtrack. A continuation of life after an existentialist or other emotional struggle. 

There are certainly many much less nuanced, artfully woven films on here that have much higher ratings from the public, and that makes me wonder what constitutes a good film for you... I thought this movie was decent. Not sure why so many people are saying it’s awful. Certainly not award caliber but it’s pretty good. The story is so creepy. This was a  wonderful movie . 63% is still a very high rating for this movie, I left the movie theater maybe the second time in my life. It was impossible to watch. ir views as almost a revenge. the female is lonely sad and trying oh so hard and doesnt show any flaws at all,  the singer is pictured as an evil jinkie who grooms her. very one sided Im not exaggerating when I say this was the worst film of 2023. Glacial pacing is fine if a movie has something new to say. Unfortunately this film is just retreading a story told many times for other figures. That story is that an iconic figure, in this case Elvis, was volatile and lead to suffering and turmoil for those they supposedly loved. Tragic and mildly interesting, but not enough so to make for how plodding it is. Slow and somewhat subtle, won't be for everyone. The acting was top notch, interestingly though no Elvis songs in the soundtrack as they didn't have an agreement with the estate. I really want the two hrs of my life back that I wasted on this trash… For it to have any high ratings is beyond me. It gave no insight to anything, and I'm sitting here like how did this make it to theaters. But that just lets you know how bias this world is…"
Drama,oppenheimer_2023,"It’s a film that, through the filter of history, dazzles with its mastery of craft, directly challenging us on how the lust for power can, and perhaps will, one day destroy us all. What might be surprising is that dropping the bomb is not that moment in history, Nolan is more interested in how one misinterpretation of a conversation can have long lasting effects. Oppenheimer is a phenomenal achievement.http://tonymacklin.net/content.php?cID=1003 Oppenhiemer is a return to form for Nolan after the fiasco of Tenet. There's a great movie hiding amidst all of the formal pyrotechnics. But I guess it's too much to ask for a lighter touch from a director who is about as subtle as an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer is ultimately a cautionary tale about ego, politics, and power, a true, modern epic. As increasing tensions with Russia rise once again, it seems fitting that ""Oppenheimer"" sets forth the events that led to those initial tensions in aftermath of World War II. It's the bomb. What promises to be Christopher Nolan's first cinematic masterpiece, evaporates before our eyes.
 For a film so enmeshed in ideas and loaded with meeting and conversations and debates (scientific and moral), it is as visually compelling as it is narratively.  Downey’s performance is one of subtlety and guile, right up to the last twist. I have never seen an actor so thoroughly redeemed by taking a hard, thankless role like this. Christopher Nolan’s latest is also his best-ever film. Fully at the height of his large-format artistic powers, he crafts a towering and monumental achievement that is highly difficult to watch but continuously thrilling. Unlike many epics, Oppenheimer is an actor’s dream. What do you want from theory alone? Pugh is heartbreaking, but doesn't get to shine as much as Emily Blunt (as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty). Long-suffering thanks to her husband's obsessive career and dalliances, Blunt nonetheless provides needed steel for Bob in the final scenes. I liked it, but thought the third act nearly cratered the whole thing. Nolan is a master of adding tension where there is very little, while deflating strenuous moments and creating an environment that is almost unbearable. The film’s narrative, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, encompasses an effective blend of historical documentary with dramatic thriller and biography.
 A violent reckoning with America’s bloodlust, filtered through a man whose ego and naïveté facilitated one of the most unspeakable monstrosities in the history of the world; an unprecedented devastation that still reverberates through civilizations today. Only Christopher Nolan could adapt Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s “American Prometheus,” a mammoth tome about American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, and have audiences gobble it up like his more traditional summer popcorn films  Epic in scale and substance, writer-director Christopher Nolan has arguably produced the best film of his impressive career. He delivers a nuanced script ... and turns a complex and defining moment in history into a pulse-pounding thriller.","Are you kidding! Amazingly. In every way Hugely overrated film. it's not bad, but frankly it lacks dramatic conflict. There are no villains, or even misguided people filling the villain role. It's just centered on Oppenheimer, who really isn't that interesting as a person. He was basically a mid-level manager who knew a lot about physics. 

Robert Downey Jr. was the best part of the film.

Florence Pugh was wasted in her role as Oppenheimer's mistress. She is so much better than this.

As for Cillian Murphy...he played the role well, what there was to play. Cillian Murphy crushed this role so well also Robert Downey Jr did an incredible job, pretty much whole cast was good and played their parts well, this movie in its own is a masterpiece. Making a movie that isn’t an action movie, but still entertains you like one is one hell of an achievement. Nolan did not disappoint with Oppenheimer Big fan of American Prometheus and figured this was overhyped. I was wrong: Favorite film in recent memory. Powerhouse filmmaking. True cinema. Def gonna be in the history books Yes. Just, yes. This is perfect representation of the word ""good"". Although it took me the course of a few days to watch, I remember every second of it. Definitely a must-see, absolutely astonishing soundtrack and visuals, realism, science, just... this movie leaves you in awe. With the combination of Christopher Nolan's direction and a very well convicted story that was filled with stakes along with the performances of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr, I can see why Oppenheimer scored a load of accolades. Incredible. Just an amazing watch all the way through. Boring review of history; no surprises, no story, no interesting characters.  Waste of time. The majority of the audience is truly in love with this film while a small percentage of the audience like myself thinks it's a snoozefest and a complete miscast from every corner. Mat Damon did absolutely nothing to his character while I lost it when Freddie Mercury showed up out of the blue! In honesty, a film like this gets made solely for Hollywood to pad themselves in the back and hand out awards to each other. An absolute self serving platitude in the making indeed. Assisti ao filme no cinema e reassisti recentemente, mas vale a Review aqui.
Nolan proporciona uma experiência audiovisual única, não é atoa que o filme foi indicado a diversas categorias no Oscar, ele com certeza entra na lista de filmes que você precisa assistir antes de morrer. It was really a good movie. 

I couldn't expect less than this when it comes to the god Christopher Nolan directing a movie. Cillian Murphy nailed his role. Never have I seen a movie that has made me think as hard as this. In my opinion, this just might be the greatest film I've ever seen! Dare I say, my top favourite movie of all time. Definitely well deserved of that best picture. I hate long movies but I didn't mind with this one. The story that it tells is fascinating, and I think they did a good job representing the people that were involved when this happened. However, I think that if you are gonna watch I advise you do a quick Google search on a few things and also Oppenheimer's biography. While watching I found some things kind of confusing and got kinda lost at some point because I have like 0 history knowledge. 

I don't know what the whole Barbie vs Oppenheimer deal was last year lol, I found both movies amazing and both are worth watching. Best movie of the year and an amazing achievement in cinema. Pretty good biopic but has an awkward sex scene in it, especially when I have watched it in school. This is an amazing story.  This is a horrible movie.  The music is so freaking disgusting my head almost exploded.  The editing and time shifting made me long for Nolan’s hideously overwrought inception.  Why?  For what purpose other than because he could.  Did I mention the music?  Intrusive. Adolescent. Uninteresting. Pathetic. Loud. Wrong It was fine. I guess that is about the best way I can explain it. But if you really want to get down to brass tax ... It was three hours long and felt every minute of six hours long. I'm beginning to wonder if Nolan is actually a good director or if Heath Ledger can make even him look like a master. He always has his moments (except for Tenet, which he made completely unwatchable with the sound), but I don't think enough of them to really make me a fan. His work is good, but I think it could be much better. Les deux premières heures sont un chef d'œuvre, à tous les niveaux. Rythme, réalisation, jeu d'acteur... La prestation de Cillian Murphy est incroyable. Cette première partie pourrait être un de mes films préféré s'il n'y avait pas eu la dernière heure ennuyante, qui aurait dû être traitée en 15 minutes selon moi. D'autant plus que ce n'est que la clôture d'un ""procès"" qui avance en parallèle de l'histoire principale depuis le début du film. Beaucoup trop long. Autre point négatif : l'explosion de la bombe, qui n'est pas à la hauteur. Si je devais résumer : un film à ne rater sous aucun prétexte malgré une fin longue et décevante."

Nolan did not disappoint with Oppenheimer Big fan of American Prometheus and figured this was overhyped. I was wrong: Favorite film in recent memory. Powerhouse filmmaking. True cinema. Def gonna be in the history books Yes. Just, yes. This is perfect representation of the word ""good"". Although it took me the course of a few days to watch, I remember every second of it. Definitely a must-see, absolutely astonishing soundtrack and visuals, realism, science, just... this movie leaves you in awe. With the combination of Christopher Nolan's direction and a very well convicted story that was filled with stakes along with the performances of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr, I can see why Oppenheimer scored a load of accolades. Incredible. Just an amazing watch all the way through. Boring review of history; no surprises, no story, no interesting characters.  Waste of time. The majority of the audience is truly in love with this film while a small percentage of the audience like myself thinks it's a snoozefest and a complete miscast from every corner. Mat Damon did absolutely nothing to his character while I lost it when Freddie Mercury showed up out of the blue! In honesty, a film like this gets made solely for Hollywood to pad themselves in the back and hand out awards to each other. An absolute self serving platitude in the making indeed. Assisti ao filme no cinema e reassisti recentemente, mas vale a Review aqui.
Nolan proporciona uma experiência audiovisual única, não é atoa que o filme foi indicado a diversas categorias no Oscar, ele com certeza entra na lista de filmes que você precisa assistir antes de morrer. It was really a good movie. 

I couldn't expect less than this when it comes to the god Christopher Nolan directing a movie. Cillian Murphy nailed his role. Never have I seen a movie that has made me think as hard as this. In my opinion, this just might be the greatest film I've ever seen! Dare I say, my top favourite movie of all time. Definitely well deserved of that best picture. I hate long movies but I didn't mind with this one. The story that it tells is fascinating, and I think they did a good job representing the people that were involved when this happened. However, I think that if you are gonna watch I advise you do a quick Google search on a few things and also Oppenheimer's biography. While watching I found some things kind of confusing and got kinda lost at some point because I have like 0 history knowledge. 

I don't know what the whole Barbie vs Oppenheimer deal was last year lol, I found both movies amazing and both are worth watching. Best movie of the year and an amazing achievement in cinema. Pretty good biopic but has an awkward sex scene in it, especially when I have watched it in school. This is an amazing story.  This is a horrible movie.  The music is so freaking disgusting my head almost exploded.  The editing and time shifting made me long for Nolan’s hideously overwrought inception.  Why?  For what purpose other than because he could.  Did I mention the music?  Intrusive. Adolescent. Uninteresting. Pathetic. Loud. Wrong It was fine. I guess that is about the best way I can explain it. But if you really want to get down to brass tax ... It was three hours long and felt every minute of six hours long. I'm beginning to wonder if Nolan is actually a good director or if Heath Ledger can make even him look like a master. He always has his moments (except for Tenet, which he made completely unwatchable with the sound), but I don't think enough of them to really make me a fan. His work is good, but I think it could be much better. Les deux premières heures sont un chef d'œuvre, à tous les niveaux. Rythme, réalisation, jeu d'acteur... La prestation de Cillian Murphy est incroyable. Cette première partie pourrait être un de mes films préféré s'il n'y avait pas eu la dernière heure ennuyante, qui aurait dû être traitée en 15 minutes selon moi. D'autant plus que ce n'est que la clôture d'un ""procès"" qui avance en parallèle de l'histoire principale depuis le début du film. Beaucoup trop long. Autre point négatif : l'explosion de la bombe, qui n'est pas à la hauteur. Si je devais résumer : un film à ne rater sous aucun prétexte malgré une fin longue et décevante."
Drama,napoleon_2023,"A paint-by-numbers biopic that seems woefully indecisive in its opinion of the man whose story it’s portraying. I’m invigorated and inspired by the fact that a movie like Napoleon can exist in the modern era ... the blend of war epic and farcical romance, acted and directed masterfully, is the kind of full spectacle that we go to the movies for. I mean, the movie was perplexing at points, but this reads like someone having an out-of-body experience... Each act contains a spectacle-filled battle scene, beautifully choreographed, lit, and shot. Scott (“Gladiator”) knows what he’s doing with action scenes. No complaints here. The rest of the narrative trips him up, however.  Napoleon is a challenging epic. Napoleon is the confluence of two centuries of documentation and innuendo, and how, maybe, a tyrant who led millions to their death doesn’t deserve better than to be portrayed as a weird little guy horny for his mean wife. Scott’s depiction of Napoleonic warfare is equal parts beautiful and brutal. “Napoleon” is a gorgeous movie, but you won’t see it when you fall asleep between battles. The combination of pitch perfect visuals with comedic, outlandish dialogue does not ever gel, and Scott lacks the necessary pacing to let everyone enjoy the joke.  A battle-laden pilgrimage through the historical highlights of France's most prolific Emperor cuts considerable corners in conveying his military machinations. Questionable casting, jarring tonal shifts and a repetitive dependence on the battlefield... On its way to theatrical release, 'Napoleon' has lost an hour and a half of footage, affecting a dramatic progression that feels too disjointed, cold, and at times, lacking in soul.  This lavish production never feels like an incredible story, nor does it ever feel particularly intimate. Truthfully, Napoleon rarely feels like anything; perfunctory emotions that are adequately portrayed by talented actors adrift in a sea of tedium. This two and a half hour-plus battle-heavy film shies away from nothing and really does give you kind of what you expect- epic action in a way that we know and love Ridley Scott for and a bonkers performance that we know and love Joaquin Phoenix for. Although I was never bored, this two-and-a-half-hour film made me feel like I was sitting through a three-and-a-half-hour film.
 Napoleon is a shallow collection of impressions, “psychological” insight of the dime-store variety and brief battle scenes, which are not even presented so as to explain Napoleon’s military prowess. Who was it that said history was just one damn thing after another? This is what Sir Ridley Scott's epic [...] feels like when not focused on the electrifying performance of Joaquin Phoenix.  Ridley Scott's ""Napoleon"" is more of a romantic epic than an exploration of the personality of a despot. [Full Review in Spanish] Tonally, it’s flat and unengaging, leaving us uncertain whether we should be taking it seriously or reading Phoenix’s simpering interpretation of Napoleon as satire. Scott makes no apologies for Napoleon and never treats him as some hero for France. Napoleon succeeds at presenting the insecurities of this man’s life for audiences who may be unaware of French history. I just wish it was narrower in its scope. Joaquin Phoenix’s blustering performance conquers as Napoleon. This is such a misfire. It is 2 hours and 38 minutes of my life I would like back. At the end of the movie, I knew nothing more about Napoleon than I did when it started.","Didn't do Bonaparte any justice, the thick American accents take me right out of the moment. Although, there are many historical inaccuracies that part is relatively easy to get over. The movie feels like a bunch of trailers strung together, into a jumbled mess and embarrassment to Napoleon's story. There is nearly zero indication in the movie that Napoleon is a great or even decent general. All in all a mumbled together movie which likely needed its own show, but Ridley Scott would mess that up so. I enjoy these types of movies but this one wasn’t my favorite. I felt like it had some good parts, especially the action scenes. They did a great job building the scene and tensions. The problem was that it felt a little too long and they probably could have cut some scenes short to speed up the pacing. The scenes between the battles dragged on a little bit and I got bored from it. yawn, yawn and yawn. it was too long and read about it in a history book. you'll find it more interesting. Watch anything on history march instead http://youtu.be/55dNKFvKuQs?si=gaUQoJRE5Er1q8XR Snooze Fest! Not the best performance from Phoenix. Editing seems to be a lost art in Hollywood these days. The sex scenes were perverted and gratuitous. It would be easy enough to suggest what is happening in a classy way with some well timed edits, instead these cringe sex scenes just made a mockery of the relationship of Napoleon and his empress. Slept throughout half of it. Terrible acting, lots of violence and little to learn or appreciate about the film. First of all, like most movies he stars in, Joachim Phoenix owns this movie.

The battle scenes are immense as you would expect, and despite what many of the 'real' critics say, there are plenty of these action sequences to keep you engaged in between the non-action scenes.

If you can forgive the lack of French accents from, you know, the guys playing the French parts, and you like a good historic war drama, you should enjoy this film. A pretty decent film. If you’re going to deviate that much from undisputed historical sources, just create a fictional character. The script was horrible. In my opinion, Director mistake is a lack of dcreen time - the story of Napoleon deserve more films - at least 4, like his company in russia, described in War And Peace, was filmed as 4 movies, waterloo was the long seperate movie, but he tried hid best - Phoenix is perfectly suitable for this role looks like a movie made by a person who don’t know nothing about history One of the biggest cinematic disappointments in recent memory. Terribly written, and even more poorly acted. Perhaps the worst performance of Joaquin Phoenix’s career. Difícil de ver, errores históticos, casi parece un fan fiction de Bonaparte. My god., I couldn't stay more than 30min. So boring. So stupid. I'm French so I loves to see all English speakers too 😂😂
Thanks ridley Scott to let me waste 30min of my life 🍅 6.3/10


Joaquin Phoenix Really do be making them clap sounds 🤨 I mean since he’s short a couple inches had to go somewhere right. It’s nothing bad just nothing remarkable it feels like it should be more epic but ends up being a stale drama that focuses on its most uninteresting plot. Still there’s some pretty cool fights and great set pieces and the performances are pretty good all around. Grade B This movie was truly made only for the big screen. I enjoyed it immensely.  Joaquin pheonix is sublime as napoleon and Ridley Scott delivers his battle sequences in perfect formation. Enjoyable flick but I feel Joaquin Phoenix was miscast on this one. He seemed too sluggish and docile to be
the aggressive French Emperor that carved out a name for himself forever in the history books.
The final battle scene at Waterloo was fantastic though and worth watching just for that. Bad movie. Bonaparte was not a kid or a puppet. How can the director write : 6 millions people died because of Napoléon? 6 millions soldiers died because of kings and kingdoms around France were afraid about loosing their power.
It's juste an example : this movie is a story not History.
No need to watch this stupid movie."
Drama,animal_2023_2,"Intellectually bankrupt, morally reprehensible and stylistically inept, Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Animal is about as irredeemable as they come. The movies best and worst qualities come from how bold and excessive everything is. The movie is totally unrestrained.  That makes the sequences and characters memorable, but it also makes the runtime totally unnecessary. Trashy, idiotic, and filled with disgusting bloody violence that's overly repetitive, Animal is excruciatingly too long at about 200 minutes. This garbage movie has no redeeming qualities. It's yet another stupid story about feuding and vengeful families. Beyond the never ending reign of bullets and butcherings, both Animal and Kapoor's vicious Ranvijay remain hollow. Animal is a complicated film with a top-tier Ranbir Kapoor, who delivers a powerhouse performance that is worth the price of admission alone. What the film lacks in substance, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga makes up for with sheer audacity and bloodshed. Ranbir Kapoor is deeply committed to his brash and ugly protagonist, but in spite of the movie’s explosive action, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga seems more preoccupied with provoking outrage than with telling a coherent story. Boring, blood-spattered film... Animal’s terrible attitude to women runs alongside a cunning use of India’s religious minorities.  Bigger, longer, bloodier: Animal is all that and more. A story which is cheerfully misogynistic, morally bankrupt and stomach-churningly violent.  All of which I could have endured if the drama and emotions had held.  It is easy to dismiss Animal as an indulgent film, one that achieves none of what it sets out to. It is. It is repulsive, revolting, and one-and-a-half- hours too long. But it is also a film that unravels as retaliation. The film washes past you, like sandpaper being rubbed against your aesthetic and moral convictions.  Watch Animal to see Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor rising above the ridiculous to give a sublime performance. Ranbir Kapoor stars in a blood-soaked drama about daddy issues that is screaming at the top of its lungs with nothing to say. Ranbir Kapoor plays one of the vilest protagonists in cinema history. ANIMAL is a pretty crazy, but somehow totally original and fresh THE GODFATHER remix, with an insane Ranbir Kapoor, a super strong Rashmika Mandanna, great music and, above all, the right amount of humor and irony. The main objective is to serve up everything and the kitchen sink. It can’t be called a cinematic feast, as it is a chore for moviegoers forced to digest heaps of plot points and tangents.  At three hours 21 minutes, Animal is relentless as a euphoric medley of feral rage and dance of the dysfunctional. The twists go on well until end credits as more blood is splattered our way. Welcome to the jungle. Like nearly every factor here, the songs and blood-soaked interludes alike are not without skill, but get kick-dropped into an inorganic whole uninterested in integrating them to sustained, logical or emotionally credible effect. During the interval, I was at a loss of theories. I didn’t know what to make of him or the film. All I could ask was: What’s the point? Why is Animal? Animal is an adrenaline experience which will have polarising views but you can't deny its entertaining quotient, breathtaking performances and storytelling.","WORST MOVIE EVER MADE FOR MANKIND! I appreciate you bobby deol This critic and audience rating difference can be explained by critic females (most movie critics are females) offended by some scenes from the movie. 

This epic motion picture with phenomenal cast, production and direction deserves a one time watch.
Drama and story are not the best. Quite long but wasn't as bad as expected. I didn't find the content so problematic for the first half. Not sure if that was done by the filmmakers for marketing. Had my mind blown by the film 'Animal'! Ranbir Kapoor is on another level, redefining the game with his acting prowess. He brings a perfect blend of swag, emotions, good looks and upholds the Kapoor legacy.
Sandeep Reddy Vanga, the Kabir Singh magician, does it again! Animal is a wild ride of unpredictability, killer action, outstanding screenplay and songs that will stay on loop. The storyline is wild, the action is killer, and those Punjabi beats and dialogues make it a total paisa vasool experience! 💯

Sure, there's been chatter about the film's themes, but isn't cinema supposed to spark discussions? Remember 'Kabir Singh'? The debates around it contributed to its massive success.😂 'Animal' is following suit, gearing up to cross the 800-900 crore mark. 

Art is subjective, and every piece has room for improvement. Each one has their own opinion. While the film might lack a conventional storyline and robust female characters, let's also celebrate the positives. As a cinephile, those 3 hours and 21 minutes were pure entertainment. Sometimes, that's all you need. Just leave your mind at home for this one and you will enjoy! 😄

And can we talk about the Deol brothers making a comeback? Sunny Deol's all-time blockbuster 'Gadar 2' and Bobby Deol doing his mad barbaric thing in 'Animal'- nostalgia hit me like a truck this year. They made our millennial days better with their unforgettable performances in great films! ‘Lord Bobby’ deserves all the appreciation he has been receiving! In fact it has been a great year for the entire Deol family, as veteran actor Dharamendra also gave a good performance in RRKPK!

Here's to cinema that makes us think, feel, and appreciate the craft!

PS: Remember, if film characters really inspired people in reality, most of us would be criminals, roaming around with guns, smoking, drinking all day, practicing domestic violence, etc. etc. Thankfully, it's just the magic of the movies. Stopped watching after the gun fight. It was too much and unrealistic. How in the world this type of a trashy movie was approved? All the female characters were objectified. Specifically saying Rashmika, who has so much potential, was interpreted as more like a mentally disabled vulgar subservient object. Who in the world would just elope with a guy who just says he's the Alpha and commented about your PELVIS. Made no SENSE to me. Too much unnecessary intimacy and useless dialogues. That scene where Ranbir complains about his underwear, I still wonder how that part  connected to the storyline. I don't know what happened afterwards because I could not tolerate this garbage. The director is a psychopath for sure who adores misogynism. I still cannot get my head over the fact that how these reputed actors and actresses agreed to even commit themselves for this trashy plot. A huge amount was put into their pockets, maybe that's why! No character development, no redemption, desensitization to its finest. Parents keep your children away from this garbage. Don't waste your time. And kindly let us rate with negatives; -1 will be the best rating if I could have given. Best Indian Movie Ever in 2023-2024! 10/10 Worst ever disgusting irritating Really if You unbiased Worst movie I have seen for a very long time. Gave up after 2 and an half hours of utter ridiculousness!!!!

Save yourselves wasting 3.5hrs of your life!!! Worst movie ever. No dialogues, no story, too much irrational scenes. Violations. Giving wrong motivations to society. What.the.hell.was.that?! 

I'm fine with gore but good grief! The dialogues, for one thing. Who the hell talks like that?! There were SO many unnecessary scenes, drawn out to eternity for no reason at all. I went in thinking perhaps it's highly stylized. No. It was just bad. 

In short, a terrible storyline to justify gore. Good and the best theater experiance I have watched thousands of movies in my life and this one would be very hard to beat when it comes to being an absolutely horrible, non-sensical and meaningless movie! Ranbir's ""acting"" is trashy and vaudevillian at best. Other characters are there just to fill up the screen and spray bullets at other characters who are also there to fill up the screen. Overall, a complete waste of 2.5 hours of my life. Possibly the most pointless movie with no entertainment element. Truth is that there's no place in this planet where you can relate this movie, it's Unreal. This movie is like video game. In reality there's a law and we all have to obey it.

Acting wise Ranbir is good, Rashmika below average, tripti - good, Bobby - good. Performance and body language of 'saurabh sachdeva' is really impressive. Direction of Reddy sir is fine but again this planet doesn't deserve this kind of cinema. Father- son relationship doesn't go like that, you can't kill hundreds of people to prove that bonding, In reality if you does you will be charged with different sections and will be prosecuted.

4 stars for music. Thanks. A very good bollywood film in a long time! Utterly ridiculous and disturbing story. Non sense and nonstop violence with no moral at the end . Extremely disappointed. Movie of the decade.

Everything is great about this movie.
Already watched it two times.
Will watch it again. Great fun time at the movies & I can't wait got the sequel Honestly hated how he cheated on his wife like it was nothing but if she did the same thing he would kill the guy ... Made me so angry"
Drama,saltburn,"While its debaucherous presentation of lavish lifestyles may prove a bit much or strange for certain audiences, its strengths lie in its performances, assertive craftsmanship, and its critical, if perhaps somewhat muddy, themes on avarice.  A delicious sort of contradiction in Saltburn sets the tone for the entire film. A carefully-constructed masterpiece... The film doesn’t really say anything new about the rich, or the social climbers who imitate them, but it’s plenty entertaining even as it veers into borderline camp territory in the final twenty minutes.  Saltburn isn’t going to leave you feeling warm and fuzzy, but sometimes, I prefer to feel horrified and giggling to avoid my own discomfort. Buckle up for some fun. Barry Keoghan steals the scenes. Keoghan plays a doe-eyed sociopath, obsessed, dark, and aloof, with such grounded insanity that it brings to mind his earlier roles in The Green Knight and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. It’s impossible not to sense the film completely slipping from her once the narrative begins unveiling a bold set of reveals in this final third. It’s Gothic stateliness by way of Goth subculture -- enter at your own risk. These liaisons aren't nearly dangerous enough in Emerald Fennell's initially interesting but ultimately feckless exercise in the depravity of class issues and the polite homophobia of the mid-2000s.  Writer/director Emerald Fennell helps usher in 2023 as the year that Cinema vaulted back to life, with a transgressive black comedy that splashes cum-soaked mud on corporate cinema with tireless glee.

Comic book movies be damned. You don’t get to feed us nonsense and then expect us to thank you when you try to explain it. Derivative it may be – the plot is a salad of ideas pinched from Evelyn Waugh, Patricia Highsmith and Pasolini – you won’t be bored for a second. It was impossible to shake the comparison to Ripley with Saltburn while I was watching it, but I still tried to revel in Fennell’s audaciousness, coupled with a truly game and committed performance from Keoghan. Exasperatingly toxic psycho sexual drama - that varies between bizarre and disgusting A weird, intense movie that has the courage of its convictions. Barry Keoghan gives a brilliant performance as the complicated, many-sided Oliver Quick, ably supported by the rest of this talented cast. Writer-director Emerald Fennell creates a wicked study of social classes with some surprising plot twists.  Saltburn sparked discussion, but for all its stylized images and clever gendered trope inversions, its queer promises are empty. A great time produced by a great director without being a great movie. Saltburn is a brilliant movie that is almost brought down by a poorly written ending. Saltburn is pretty and plenty of its audience will delight in being able to say they were in on the joke whenever the film resurfaces on social media. A viral movie is not necessarily a good movie.","I loved this movie and would recommend a watch. There are some shocking moments that are unexpected, pushing the boundaries. Barry playing Oliver is so fabulous. He always plays that creepy role so well but my fav character was the Elspeth, I think Rosamund did a brilliant job in her performance. I have debated with friends on whether it was necessary to have an ending that goes back an explains what happened. For me I think it was fine as is so I give 5 stars. A cinematic masterpiece. I advice you to dive deeper into the foreshadowing throughout the film… you will not be disappointed! An interesting film - one comment that I thought would describe it accurately in describing the film would be ""The Great Gatsby meets Richard Wagner"".  Jaw dropping at times and tender at others.  Greed and avarice seem to be common themes. Cinematic art. 
Emotional rollercoaster of going from mysterious and sexy, to uncomfortable and unhinged. 
Should come with a warning This film felt like a sick and twisted reimagining of the Great Gatsby. I was intrigued and appaled only to be intrigued once again. It was an unexpected ride and by the end I kind of wanted to take it for another spin. This film surprised me by how much I ended up liking it. If you can tolerate some very obscure, obscene and even disgusting scenes, in a few parts, this will be an enjoyable albeit bizarre encounter for you. Although I had my doubts in the end I didn't regret it one bit. Stop watching half way through because i so disgusted by it, but after continue it i even more disgusted by it and amaze it at the same time i didn't expect how's this movie gonna end. It's just blow my mind and they just left me shock in there. Apart from the photography and soundtrack, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, 2 hours of pure nothingness and emptiness. By the end of the film, I was questioning how I managed to torture myself for so long. It will never make sense to me how someone could like this movie just because in the final seconds, the protagonist is revealed to be a sadistic borderline. Throughout the rest of the hours, it's just a disgusting and boring show. This film is visually and emotionally striking. I found myself more intrigued with the production aspects of the film rather than the story itself, though. It's worth a second watch. Solid acting, but the plot was unbelievable and the film got extremely weird at times. Pretentious director whose only goal is to shock you with disturbing sexual content. It’s like gore only for the sake of gore.. Unfortunately she completely sacrificed the immersion of the film because of it. I wouldn’t recommend unless you simply just want to be disgusted. Movies typically are for entertainment and to try and entertain people with such depravity is a disservice to the art. Other than that it’s not much. Great cinematography and colour grade though. Emerald Fennell is a hack. Watched on a plane. Wished it had come out in less close proximity to ""Ripley"", since it felt rather derivative. Well-acted. Want to see more of Barry Keoghan's work. A character with ASPD falls in love. It doesn't end well for his love object. Weird, disgusting. Plot was not believable at all. He killed everyone and he was never investigated or doubted. Such a movie! Wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone. So glad I didn't pay for it. Boo. Hiss. Intense, beautiful, thrilling. Only demerit would be the final monologue, it made Barry's character a bit unbelievable. Still laughing, what’s great movie. J'ai l'impression que c'est une tentative de reproduire Parasite. Tentative échouée. Je n'ai ressenti qu'un profond malaise face à un film qui ne propose que du vide et de l'obscène durant 2h. Le ""plot twist"" était prévisible à des km à l'avance, laissant un goût de déjà vu vis à vis de Parasite. Mais contrairement à ce film, Saltburn n'a pas vraiment réussi à établir un suspens ni à porter un quelconque caractère critique. Ce film est tout simplement vide. Saltburn looks fantastic and dreamy but this is ultimately a piece of hokum which lacks plausibility and conviction. It feels as if three writing teams were each given a segment and told not to talk to each other. Like a lot of films about the rich it doesn't really have much to say about them other than they are all loafing morons who eat and party all day. A much stronger story would have played this as a story of infatuation and envy but instead the writers go for what they consider to be shocking and forego the plot in the search for jumbling a lot of moments in the hope they stick together. It's a narrative mess by the end and a real disappointment. Na this one was too weird and also disgusting at some parts. Not sure why people would like this movie. Oliver was twisted to a point where I just wanted to punch him in the face the whole movie!"
Drama,the_holdovers,"In a time when things often seem so hopeless, when the same forces of inequality and military injustices plague our own world, perhaps it’s this film’s realistic salve that makes it resonate so strongly.
 Despite the anxiety and even sadness its story exudes, it’s a movie so in love with its characters, and so steadfast in its humanist convictions, that it reaches into your soul and melts even the most frozen of hearts. The Sideways actor-director duo combine once again for a terrific, bittersweet rumination on life, love and grief. Giamatti and Payne are a movie match made in heaven Payne crafts a movie about the human condition and the loveliness and messiness that goes with it. The Holdovers is a more challenging movie than it might appear on the surface. Unfortunately, The Holdovers really lives up to its name. ... Worth seeing for its playful homage to a very specific slice of cinema history, for its three lead performances, and for a few very good scenes that come before those last, long 30 minutes. Randolph takes the pain and the imminent grief that her character is feeling to the core, making her chain-smoking adaptation to the situation, while watching the game shows and interacting with the other characters all the more impactful. Absolutely nothing new happens in Alexander Payne’s surprisingly warm and fuzzy film, but it’s a perfectly fine way to while away 135 minutes. And — who knows? — you might even remember some well-worn yet valuable life lessons. Anchored by Giamatti’s compelling central performance ..., The Holdovers takes a meaningful dive into a complex world of emotional conflict ""The Holdovers"" should become a holiday movie classic for audiences to return to every Thanksgiving to keep some perspective on human nature, hypocrisy, and the importance of having a warm heart and a calm mind. A small-scale gem that, by utilizing a 1970s setting, manages to recall the intimate cinema of that period. Giamatti’s performance is a pleasure to watch. He is the presiding presence in the movie, and David Hemingson’s erudite screenplay allows him free range to deliver long lines of invective.  It's the beautifully-written characters and the actors that inhabit them that will surely receive the most plaudits A new American classic.  In a film that manages to be touching and consistently funny, you won’t be surprised to learn that a rapport develops between existentially miserable Paul, who seeks solace in Jim Beam and Marcus Aurelius, and prickly, troublesome Angus. Giamatti doesn’t let Paul’s character tics, which include a prominent lazy eye, to distract from the more subtle aspects of his performance. The film is a throwback to the soul-stirring narratives of 70s movies. There’s a lot of attention to detail as it immerses the audience in a time of societal shifts and cultural upheaval. The three leads work well together and you will root for them, although there is a predictability and heavy-handedness to the story that makes it less moving than it would otherwise be. The warmth with which Payne shows the humanity in his characters helps each one of them unfold into a real, complex person.","I'm thinking it's me,  I love the idea but for me it's messy lead up to a messed up crux. Partly editing but a basic inability to grab, hold and sustain a script that doesn't exist. I want to give kind heartening words but they stuffed up it's intrinsicness. Like stepping up to bat and the game being called off. This movie was great. A great plot with top notch acting from Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da’Vine Joy Randolph. I just hope there’s no sequel or spinoff. This was a good one and done for me and I’d hate to see it get ruined. The Holdovers is a leisurely paced movie that effortlessly blends humor, character development, and heart. Paul Giammati has always been a very versatile actor and should have won an oscar for delivering a masterclass performance in this movie as a Professor trapped in a shell of cynicism and grief, trying to survive and supervise a handful of students.

A movie that depicts an unexpected journey of growth and connection. 
The film excels in its character-driven narrative, avoiding a predictable plot to explore the complexities of human emotion. A testament to the power of unexpected friendships and the healing potential of shared experiences.

A heartwarming and thought-provoking film that will linger and serve as a reminder that even the most hardened hearts can find redemption and joy in unexpected places and people. An all around great slice of life story that brought me to a place of nostalgia for an era I didn’t even live through. Great acting by all and the cinematography summoned that nostalgia and immerses you in the world of that era. OMG yes - I almost skipped this one, but just kept hanging in. The 70's imagery and cold weather put me back in the days when heating wasn't so good... and the movie had a really good, strong impact. Una bella película sobre perdedores, sobre abandonados, casi sobre olvidados, con todo el espíritu navideño, aunque su ritmo lento y pasivo hace que se sienta larga. Provavelmente por já ter lecionado, filmes que retratam professores apaixonados por sua profissão e alunos problemáticos sempre me arrancam lágrimas e me deixam com o coração quentinho... A trilha sonora por si só já nos leva as lágrimas… Adorei o humor acido e afiado, e apesar da firmeza e aparente frieza do professor, temos um homem com um grande coração e muito amor... A toxidade paterna explícita e abandono parental... Deliciosamente sereno de degustar... Well done with some great acting & screen writing Typical maudlin U.S. cheese. This is my FAVORITE SURPRISE MOVIE of the year. Fabulous. It was so unnecessarily long and boring. Paul Giamatti is one of my favorite actors, but he couldn't make this bearable. It was so stale and boring. Great to watch if you want to fall asleep This film clinched my love for Paul Giamatti. DaVine’s performance was flawless. I gave it 30 minutes, and it did nothing to make me want to keep watching it . Paul Giamatti is one of my fav actors, but even he couldn't make this batch of uncharismatic kids watchable. 

Paul's character's dialogue is the one thing that kept me engaged and watching for the 30 minutes. Maybe this movie turned it around and is excellent in the 2nd and 3rd acts, but i couldn't see this movie surprising me with anything i hadn't already predicted. Great movie, the kind they rarely make anymore. We go from dislike to sympathizing to admiration even, so naturally, for both main characters. Its very much a movie about Kids seeing the faults and humanity in their surrounding adults, as the adults learn to respect the hardship of being a kid/teen who cannot yet control their destiny, but must build their character instead. 
Had a lovely time watching it, all actors did a great job. Sessa really held his own with the giant gift to film that is Pal Giamatti. not an easy feat. Pretty much enjoyed every minute, it was a delight I regret wasting my time on this movie. The characters are dull and uninteresting, and the plot is predictable. Compared to this movie, Good Will Hunting is a masterpiece). Alexander Payne is one of the best film makers going around and this is one of his finest. Great cast and wonderful storytelling. Highly recommend. Just finished watching this on Amazon prime. 10 out of 10. Perfectly cast. Perfectly edited. Wonderful story. The acting? Impeccable, every single character, again perfectly cast. A bit too long at 2H 13 minutes, but great acting and a very touching ""slice of life"" movie. 

I had a great curmudgeon English teacher in High School.  I think he would have sliced out 15 to 30 minutes with red ink.  What grade would he have given?  Probably a B. ""Stand up for the Lady, you Royal Bore!"" I could listen to the dialogue and thoughtful conversation from 1970 all the time. After learning that these Characters and events were based on the writers' memories as children wandering with their uncle, this movie became nostalgic to me. The cinematography and choice to film digitally with a 55 mm lens to give the perfect aesthetic of 1970 made this movie so dreamy to me- They drink Miller High Life Champagne of beers. It made me weep towards the end. What someone will do for another is Amazing!"
Drama,poor_things,"Destined to go down as one of 2023’s best and most memorable films, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos at the height of his peculiar power. Poor Things is a wildly entertaining quest for liberation and a true cinematic tour de force that wears its technicolor heart on its sleeve. It's easy to question the legitimacy of Yorgos Lanthimos's Poor Things in the first few minutes. Is it the story of a mad disfigured scientist holding a young woman hostage under the guise of science and fatherhood? Poor Things is not Lanthimos's best film. I believe The Killing of a Sacred Deer still holds that title, but this is the most fun Lanthimos' work on screen a deliriously droll cinematic whirligig that lands somewhere between Jean-Pierre Jeunet and the plastic ennui of And the Ship Sails On…but with eye-stabbing and mad science and ball gags. Lanthimos and McNamara throw in a hell of a lot in Poor Things. Thankfully, it’s a horny, gorgeous hell of a lot. Trust Lanthimos to make a film where the cast prepped by going to mortician school. Yet for all the delightful derangement, there's a refreshing lack of resignation... Poor Things is a very funny film, with acute social satire and an anti-romantic comedy premise rendered in gonzo, Gilliam-esque fashion. It’s also deeply cynical, though it justifies its own cynicism in its commitment to the bit. Emma Stone is fearless as a creature searching for her humanity in this twisted retelling.  I can honestly say that I appreciated Poor Things. I am less sure I can claim to have entirely enjoyed it. Stone is fabulous as a woman (re)discovering her zest for life, and Mark Ruffalo is a great, wickedly charming villain. If I had the choice of watching a final movie before giving up the ghost, it would have to be Poor Things. It ranks among my all-time personal favourites and is one of the wittiest and funniest films to hit cinema screens in years. There are not a lot of times where both actor and audience are having fun with a performance. Emma Stone was having the time of her life with Bella Baxter. “Poor Things” is Lanthimos’ most optimistic film because the narrative arcs towards a utopian paradise cobbled together from society’s margins, the titular reference, except it would be a mistake to pity any of the characters  A statement about the illusion of bodily autonomy. Life is strange and then there’s Poor Things. Set in a steampunk world of Victorian custom, Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) learns to experience life in her own way even if it grates against societal norms. A film that needs to be seen to be believed and then experienced. Poor Things is proof that there is room for weirdly wonderful cinema in this world. ""Poor Things"" coincides with Emerld Fennell's ""Saltburn"" in confronting Hollywood's gun-happy format with something considerably more grounded, namely the sex urge that drives people, and the social curiosity that comes along with it. The best film of 2023. A Frankenstein Meets Forrest Gump flick filtered through a feminist focus.","Emma está perfeita e faz uma atuação que se transforma! How can this out of from human mind? Amazing. 
Splendid casting crew Amazing story! This is one of my favorite movie now. And damn Emma Stone she’ beautiful! Amazing. It is obvious that Emma Stone nominated in many types. Great movie This was quite possibly the worst movie I have seen. If Emma wasn't in this film, I don't think it would have been considered for the awards for which it was nominated. The themes were not of the sort I could relate to or found interesting whatsoever. Parts of it are blatantly pornographic and grotesque. Absolutely anger inducing how the first interactions with a ‘toddler’ are sexual and then continues to get more explicit as the movie goes on. Felt like I was watching a pedophile’s fetish film. Horrendous video I want to wash my brain and hope there aren’t any other films ever made with similar themes or else we are headed into dark times. Camera tricks and outfits were just a gimmick for a truly disgusting plot. I've finished the movie and struggle to piece together the true meaning. Is it one of freedom? Where Bella Baxter experiences the world through both an adult and adolescent lens. An experience where she faces no constraints or restricitons such as marriage, religion, polite society, or even death and fear. Whatever the meaning means, the movie is pretty good. Emma Stone's performance capture Bella's capture likeness: from the dumbest person in the room towards the start of the film to being the smartest at the end. There is alot of sex in this movie though. Haven't felt so elevated since Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam's best work. Inspired by so many classics before him but using his own imagination and inner world Lanthimos created a twisted modern fairy tale, a stab to social norms and an advocate for uniqueness. This is a brave choice he made. A fantastic movie, like few others before it and with a cast whose performances will give you chills. Costumes, set and cinematography are pure perfection! Quirky and oddball film. Better than most modern movies, but still just okay. Be warned very explicit, lude, and awkward sex scenes. A few good laughs (Mark Ruffallo dancing) and nice costumes / set designs. Not a lot to take from this one, but a passably goofy film. Beautiful movie, Emily Stone’s best movie. worst movie ever seen. Terrible movie. I couldn’t even finish watching it. From its unique, pseudo-steampunk aesthetic to its winding, fable-like plot, Poor Things is a movie from which it is truly impossible to look away. It is intense in every way a film can be, and there were moments when my disgust threatened to overcome my sense of wide-eyed enchantment - but it never quite did. It’s a great movie that keeps you engaged from start to finish. It’s unconventional, standing out from other films with brilliant acting. I love its unique style; it’s truly one of a kind Weird but cool. Enjoyed the costumes a lot. Very visually pleasing. This movie will be a classic film because of its unique story telling and brilliant cast.  Emma Stone earned her Oscar for this. Uma obra cinematográfica extremamente complexa, profunda e libertadora.
Emma espetacular em todos os sentidos. Dafoe totalmente insano (a metáfora ficou incrível) e até o Mark Hulk conseguiu surpreender.

Não é pra todos, mas deveria ser. Poor Things is an amazing movie with an amazing cast including Emma Stone. Just warning you that if you not used to sexual content, nudity, and disturbing stuff, this ain’t for you This is what happens when you let a man talk about femminist issues The best of the movie was the beautiful scenography, is like you live in a painting by Salvador Dalí, unfortunely, the plot was slow, they abused the sex scenes. It's not a bad movie, but I don't understand why it was selected as the film of the year by the Oscars."
Drama,eileen,"The darkness it laments on makes it quite an engaging movie with compelling food for thought. One just wishes it had a touch more flair to its conclusion. Eileen invites a deep reflection on the human condition, particularly in terms of dysfunctionality and family trauma. [Full review in Spanish] While not all of Oldroyd's decisions are convincing... Eileen never ceases to be a disturbing, audacious, uncomfortable, and in several ways, a provocative film. [Full review in Spanish] Eileen succeeds as a mood piece. It has a strange twist that doesn't land quite as cleanly as the filmmakers hoped it would. Eileen carries a timeless tale of womanhood, suppression, and resentment told through the lenses of 1960s America. Like its title character, the film suffers an identity crisis, stagnating too much in the contemplative indecision between being a family drama, a work romance, or a passionate thriller. [Full Review in Spanish]
 A dreary yet dramatic film that doesn’t quite live up to its potential, it suffers from being annoyingly uneven, with a titular character that we care very little for. Maturation dressed in noir, rebellion against patriarchy, in-your-face and unapologetic, Les Diaboliques with a broken heart. [Full review in Spanish] Could use a little less restraint, like a groove that missed the entrance for a solo. Eileen is an unexpectedly captivating noir. The performances are rich, the intrigue palpable and the laughs very, very dark.  Like Lady Macbeth, this provides a terrific showcase for his multi-talented leading lady, even if Hathaway gets all the best lines and outfits. The film’s story and character arcs are broadly predictable, and there are few noteworthy plot details to speak of. ... Once logic goes out the window, it doesn’t come back. Anne Hathaway crackles as a psychotic Hitchcockian blonde in this demure, increasingly bizarre psychological melodrama.  A film that becomes something of a twisted delight, especially when an ingenious third-act rug-pull nudges the film into far darker territory.  Thomasin McKenzie as Eileen steals the show in this gorgeous film about the agony of growing up lonely and isolated in a parochial small American town. Featuring a scene stealing turn from Marin Ireland, this adaptation of Ottessa Moshfegh's book isn't afraid to revel in the messy, grossness of women. And it's all the better for it. Sexy, chilly and confronting, Eileen is a winner  The majority of the film is rock-solid, but the final scenes are so illogical, so ill-advised, and so ill-informed that they leave an awful taste in the mouth, an awful stench in the nostrils, and an awful pounding in the head. Where we ultimately end up is a little more muddled than it ought to be, and a little less unnerving than it wants to be. Still, Oldroyd controls the movie’s darkness with the slightest wisp of a mischievous smile... Despite incorporating some twists that force changes in direction, Eileen falls short of being exciting, concluding with a rushed ending that lacks surprise or shock. here’s much to like about Eileen, then, but it takes too long to get to the meaty portion of its drama and even when that arrives it doesn’t have the bold impact it was aiming for.","Better than I expected it to be. I went in not knowing much and was pleasantly surprised with how dark it was. I hated the character of the father, Jim. B+ Though Anne and Thomasin do some great acting, it simply isn't enough to give this movie any meaning at all. In fact I even nodded off close to the end. 3/10 points. The leading ladies working at this jail are cast so spot on. Eileen's a weirdo with a drunk ex cop for a dad. Hathaway is a prison shrink. When one of the inmates confesses why he killed his dad, things unravel...and end that way. For the love of god, please stop ending movies this way. It has become a widespread trend to end films in an ambiguous, and lazy way. So many great films with good acting, good setting, good characters, that suddendly decide that the best way to end the film is letting lose ends all over the place. I'm watching the film to hear a whole story, not imagine the whole third act in my head It was an interesting movie that wasn't at all what I expected. It's not horrible, it's not great. I couldn't get past the horrible portrayal of the Boston accent by Thomasin McKenzie, it's not even close and is completely distracting from the get go.   Was very disappointed the rest of the movie.  Pass. As good as the book, love Ottessa The power source for Eileen isn't the the actor playing the title character, Thomasin McKenzie, it is, Rebecca, performed by Anne Hathaway. Eileen is low in self-esteem and burdened by an alcoholic and mentally unhealthy single parent that she must care for. Rebecca has her own set of problems but its her actions to sets the story in motion. McKenzie is a fine actor but it the scriptwriter did her no favors until the movie's third act. Thomasin McKenzie plays the loser girl character really well. The movie benefits from the well-written source material. McKenzie and Hathaway give nuanced ranged performances in this remarkably lit and beautifully shot character study regardless of book adaptation it was boooring. Dull, unimaginative, and confusing, Eileen fails on so many levels. The story lacks substance, the characters lack dimension, and the ending lacks sense. Filled with great leading performances and characters this thriller is good enough to keep you interested until the end. 

Tim Treakle I would like to formally invite William Oldroyd to suck it. An unpleasant view. What starts out as a character study of horny young Eileen and her miserable life, working in a prison and living with an alcoholic father, soon inexplicably deteriorates into a horror movie. Hathaway is gorgeous here, however. And the Massachusetts accents are absurd. Great acting the plot was just embarrassingly bad. Just don’t do it. The “action” is a frustrating 15 minutes that just ends with you looking over at the person next to you with that look like did we really waste a hour and a half on that. Anne Hathaway was great I'm always a sucker for ""period pieces"". In this case the Northeast in the mid-60s. Unfortunately ""Psychological Thriller"" takes too long to get to the twisty ""thrill"" part, and the abrupt ending (you'll catch yourself wondering ""is that all there is?"") makes no sense and everything is uresolved. It has its strong points. Great 60s type ""woozy cocktail"" music, and fine acting. Ms. Hathaway has come a long way since her young ""Princess Diary"" era. And at just over 90 minutes, it won't waste too much of your time. But temper your expectations. As much as it may have tried, Hitchcock this aint. Well acted. The ending takes some thought and is consistent with what really happens .  Yes there is what we are watching and what is really happening.
That's the challenge. I loved the book, and this movie is such a faithful rendition of it that I love it, too. However, the acting, directing, and location and historical details are so well done that I think it stands alone as a movie even if you haven't read the book. But you still should read the book! This movie was so slow it should be hanging on the wall of a museum somewhere where no one goes.
Absolute snoozefest."
Drama,dream_scenario,"Borgli examines what happens to one’s self-image when thrust into the spotlight so suddenly, and when that goes wrong, what lasting harm is left? Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage) has a pretty great, if not uneventful life, but he yearns for more. His wants aren't completely out of bounds, he wants recognition, respect and the adoration of his family. Who could ask for anything more? Dream Scenario manages to create expectations during its first act, but the promises of something wild or interesting always remain at a distance; we can feel the potential, but the film never goes there Thankfully Borgli never allows his commentary on social media, masculinity, and modern celebrity to obscure the fact that our dreams can always potentially contain the sort of magic that can't always be a part of our waking life. Nicolas Cage delivers one of his best films, a study on fame, networks, and dreams. [Full review in Spanish] When the credits begin, the feeling of having had one of those great dreams interrupted, and that can never be resumed, arises. [Full review in Spanish] Given the challenge of playing someone who isn’t interesting, Cage does something interesting with every single scene. ... He’s as surprisingly funny in Dream Scenario as he was surprisingly dramatic and endearing in 2021’s Pig. While there’s a strong hint of classic Kaufman to the surrealism, there’s nothing cliche or predictable in Dream Scenario. Borgli excels at creating an atmosphere that makes the viewer question whether the scene is happening or a dream. Each dream is like a short and would make a riveting film. It is like having a horror movie short film festival in one movie. It tells us a lot about the ephemerality of fame in the modern world, social media, advertising agencies and, somewhat randomly, technology. Nic Cage is sublime and I can't complain about the supporting performances either. Full review in Spanish, More like a dream that you only kinda enjoy, don’t really remember, and feel little need to share with someone else. There’s a lot going on in the performance, and it can be riveting on a number of levels. But I was left with the nagging feeling that Dream Scenario could’ve and should’ve been more than it is, with a conclusion that matches Cage’s complexity and gusto. Neither a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare, Borgli's far-reaching satire on cancel culture and metatextual reception theory overstays its welcome but finds Nicolas Cage in fantastic form as a victim of his own Jungian conundrum. This is a daring project not because of its crazy premise, but because of the almost perfect dissection it makes of a society obsessed with the fame of unknown people... [Full review in Spanish] A psychological fantasy satire that hits a nerve with just how real this surreal trip of a movie is.

 This movie is incredibly inventive. Nicolas Cage is fantastic in this role as a man who can't quite deal with all the things that are happening to him that he has no control over.  Dream Scenario turns its approach into an excuse for a light chapter of 'Black Mirror'. Luckily for everyone, nothing that Talking Heads' music can't fix. [Full review in Spanish] Kristoffer Borgli manages to compose a comedy with the soul of a horror film. [Full review in Spanish] A dystopian fable about cancel culture that borders the line between humor and terror. [Full review in Spanish] It is original and destabilizing, moving from the surreal and the sinister to comedy with total naturalness. [Full review in Spanish]","Dream Scenario is the kind of film that makes you wonder if Nicolas Cage was born to redefine 'over-the-top' or if 'over-the-top' was invented to keep up with Nicolas Cage. It's a masterclass in eccentricity, featuring Cage in a performance so quintessentially Nic Cage that it feels like he's playing every Nic Cage meme ever made. He navigates the bizarre plot with an intensity that suggests he’s not just acting but channelling an ancient, mystical Nic Cage energy from a dimension where subtlety is a banned substance. The movie is a fever dream of outlandish scenarios and Cage’s signature quirks, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the actor's unique brand of what can only be described as ""enthusiastic lunacy."" How is this possibly at a 91%? It was ambitious and occasionally visually compelling, but the whole story and writing was atrocious.  I kept waiting for it to get good and it just didn’t.  Nothing but boomer humor It starts off as an interesting premise but quickly becomes a hamfisted and lame attempt at a cancel culture allegory There are some details that make this feel real, but it's so bizarre your milage will vary probably based on your fondness for Nicolas Cage. It not a terrible supporting cast either, but this premise kinda runs thin. Nic Cage is showing up in people's dreams. I would have been curious why, but that mystery isn't brought up. There's a tangent in the third act that took this down a major step. The movie should make you think about fame and why the quest for it isn't what it's cracked up to be. I suspect that premise could be lost in Cage's performance. Final Score: 6.5/10 Dream Scenario is one of the best comic performance by Nicholas Cage is like what if Freddy Kruger having a his origin story going inside people and teens dreams and killing them and the script is really razor sharp brilliantly idea of balancing of dark comedy and fantasy in A24 film. A truely original, interesting movie, I was grabbed by it and it kept me intrigued! I really recommend Loved Nicolas Cage in this. Just felt it could have been a good movie with a different end. The premise is great, specially for a darker movie, which this isn't, sadly. Right away, that is one of the problems, the movie does not know what it is, it is listed as ""Comedy, Drama, Mystery, Thriller, Horror"". Just pick one or two, mate, not the whole catalog.
The first half of the movie is an easy 9/10, there is suspense and drama with a sprinkle of horror, the problem is that they did not really know what to do after that and took some weird turns leading to a really bad ending. Honestly, they should've leaned into the nightmares and terror, the maddening of the main character, the building rage and evil, the consequences, the suspense, etc., instead they just go ""the dream and  nightmares just stopped and no one knows why, and here is a dream product and a teen dream house of influencers"" like WTF!? Out of nowhere the movie takes a sharp turn and abandons the whole mystery, the dreams, the nightmares, the maddening, the rage, etc.
Movie goes from 9/10 to 2/10 in the blink of an eye, really sad to see that. Overall, a 4.5/10 just because the first half of the movie is so great and Cage's acting is on point. Amazing acting and the script is perfect! An interesting and unique tale that proves if your storytelling craft is strong, you don't need a big budget and over the top CGI to make a quality movie. Cage excels here, making boring interesting. A career highlight for him This might have to be one of the best movies I have ever seen I mean Nicholas Cage was amazing in his roll he played him perfectly and just the impact it had and how it made me feel is just WOW if you like sociological dramas and movies that make u question this is is a MUST SEE it is just amazing Dream Scenario is a great movie and a nice commentary on fame and the side effects that come with it and how people will try to profit on anything new and the problems that come with it. I would certainly recommend if you want to watch a weird movie that will leave you with questions after watching. Says it’s a comedy. If it is, it’s for a total of 10 minutes combined, if that much. Two thirds in goes downhill and finishes leaving the spectators wondering only one thing, “why’d they lose their time watching this”. This movie is the type of movie that for some people, might require multiple viewings to truly understand all the concepts.
Problem is, although it's very different - which i apppreciate very much, in today's world of copy paste movies -, i don't think most people would be able to re-watch it.

Personally, i enjoyed the first half very much; it got me intrigued and hooked. But after all the weirdness that happens throughout the movie, i would have liked a more concise and definitive ending, instead of a more ambiguous and ""artsy"" one. 

At the end, i still enjoyed it but was left wanting more.

Nicholas Cage gives a great performance. One of his best ones. There were some quiet and emotional moments where he was giving it his all.

I think this is a good watch, ig you have company to you can discuss the movie's concepts and what is it about. This film will get under your skin and into your thoughts. Everything is going great until it suddenly isn’t. The power of the mind can be a frightening thing. Cage gives an exquisite performance in this provocative piece. I felt bad for him most of the movie, and there was always this tension of ‘what kind of bad situation will this get him into next’. Kristoffer Borgli dreams up an unsettling apologue about a lecturer inexplicably appearing in dreams of millions to mull over abrupt notoriety, cancel culture and proceeds to make our heads swim with weightier issues of mediocrity of existentialism and needfulness for approval. Good acting but just depressing with no happy ending or any real explanation of what happened at all. Terrible! Movie starts slow and lacks any real substance. I understand the movie concept is interesting but this film is underwhelming and not entertaining. I watched about an hour before turning off. Yo la primera mitad de la película: Ay que bonito, Nicolas Cage está recibiendo la atención de todos.
Yo la segunda mitad de la película: Mendigo coraje tengo atorado, mátalos a todos de una vez."
Drama,the_oath_2023,"It feels like a biblical epic. I know there is an audience for this because it is an old-fashioned action-adventure. It is low budget, so there is not a whole lot of CGI. It is a story of survival. A jumble of abbreviated action and stilted storytelling that, I’m guessing, will leave neither the movie’s built-in audience — members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — or anyone else satisfied. The Oath is a faith-based movie about Judeo-Christian historical people, but this tedious drama is actually very soulless. The characters, story, and filmmaking are woefully generic, while the acting performances are dismally substandard. There are some well done elements throughout the film, but there are also moments where things collapse from the pressure. At various points resembling “Gladiator,” “The Passion of the Christ,” “Dances with Wolves,” “The Last of the Mohicans,” and “Braveheart,” “The Oath” mixes elements of drama, action, romance, and fantasy to stirring effect. I appreciate the filmmakers' intentions, but pledging to watch 'The Oath' may cause severe regrets. It's certainly no sillier in any way that I could see than, say, Conan the Barbarian or the Lord of the Rings flicks. And it's at least as heartfelt. The fact that in terms of subject matter this is an unusual film doesn’t mean it’s a good one... it’s solemn, repetitive and unexciting.  Clunky, dull and undercooked while very low on thrills, suspense and emotional depth.  A limp, underfinanced Pre-Columbian “Last of the Mohicans” action adventure...and a dull MesoAmerican thriller built on Mormonism’s foundation myth, with just enough magical thinking thrown in to make everything presented here play as eye-rolling hokum.","I watched this for the live GAM show and God AWFUL movies is right. I could go on for days about this movie, but I’ll let them do their thing Saturday. Cheers to Mormon movie month always being good for some hilariously bad films with surprisingly good production quality.  At the end of all of it I only have 4 remaining questions that I’m even remotely invested in: 

1) are we all agreeing that dude totally gutted his recently murdered wife to confirm he was having a son. 

2) are we all agreeing that big sis is a shapeshifting werewolf and we’re pissed we didn’t get to watch that movie? 

3) if we’re supposed to know (and no way would you get this from the movie) that dude becomes the angel Moroni, then who is the younger, better looking, golden armor wearing angel that pops in twice with no lines? 

4) what the hell did Billy Zane do that someone has evidence of to be blackmailed into participating in this movie? Okay, first of all this has more of the feel of a short film so don't expect an epic like Braveheart. This is a period film based in the Americas prior to it's discovery by the Vikings or Christopher Columbus. The Book of Mormon - Another Testament of Jesus Christ is listed as one of the most influential books ever published in America. It is the first attempt at a serious film by a promising new Director so do not expect this to be like most modern films or television programs, which seem to always hit every checkmark and of course, it doesn't feel super slick ""Hollywood blockbuster"" yet all to often lacking any real passion or feeling. This an independent film and it feels like it, which is a good thing--as it maintains passion with a gritty, and natural feel. Of course, if you can you can get over not getting overloaded with the typical fare and just sit back, relax and, of course even better if you have read the Book of Mormon you'll more fully appreciate the cultures and people and included therein--or even if you haven't just use your imagination of what it may have been like to live another time and place, and enjoy this as one artist's passionately and creatively-crafted interpretation of a very brief moment, again it feels more like a short film which I personally enjoyed even more the second and third time watching it. Personally, I love all genres and types of film and series this one is an underrated treat that deserves a little patience and appreciation for what it is a sweet story of love, survival and sacrifice. Again, not an epic film and a unique perhaps acquired taste of what an artist with a passion can create with nothing but a love of the subject matter and characters can accomplish without big money or funding. Definitely looking forward to seeing more from this filmmaker in the future! I think it was deceptive to not let the audience know it was about the book of Mormon. Poorly executed, low budget fare. Donated to this movie production and couldnt be more disappointed. What a wasted opportunity. Seriously. Does anyone have the courage to tell Darin this was an epic fail? He wont even break even when  this is all said and done. I want to tell you about my reaction to the movie. I'm embarrassed to say I wasn't expecting it to be as polished or professional as a typical Hollywood blockbuster. This week is not only the Christmas-New Year week, it is also my birthday (December 26) and my wife's birthday (today, December 29). So, I took the day of work to celebrate. Last night Minda & I went to see ""Boys in the Boat"" and found it to be a wonderful movie, though very formulaic. I'd enthusiastically recommend it to anyone—expecially to families or other groups who want to learn to achieve greater success by working harmoniously and seamlessly. But, like I said, we chose to go see The Oath not because we expected to see a great film, but more because we like to support ""Mormon art"", excuse the expression.

Boy was I wrong.

There is nothing formulaic about The Oath and yet it presents a coherent, powerful, and beautifully told story. It is obvious that anyone who could have written the screenplay and directed this movie knows The Book of Mormon very well, loves The Book of Mormon, and has a fervent conviction of the veracity of that ancient work. Since I first read The Book of Mormon at age 15 (and at least once a year on the average since that time (I'm now 71) I've often pondered what life might have been like for Moroni after his father and all his kinsfolk had died (or deserted to join the Lamanites). Surely Moroni was hunted and no doubt had a price on his head. Anyone who's read Moroni's account realizes he was noble, bold, physically fit, of a keen intellect, and had a tender heart. Your movie portrays Moroni masterfully. It also posits a truly plausible tale of what Moroni's later life might have been like.The story moves along quickly and though it has all the compelling elements of a top-notch action movie it is more believable than any action movie I've ever seen. I wouldn't be surprised if your tale turns out to be what actually happened to Moroni. Maybe. Maybe not. But if nothing else, it is definitely a very realistic and believable touchstone of Latter-day Saint culture.

You were wonderfully imaginative in deciding to make this movie. I'm sure you (and others) prayed diligently for inspiration and guidance once you determined to go ahead and actually embark on the work. Your prayers were heard. I am often a critic of what I call an ""ego-trip movies"" where the main star is also the writer and director. Such movies are almost always dismal failures...hokie to the extreme. Take WaterWorld and Yentl, for example. I don't see any ego getting in the way of The Oath, however. I think only a bold, creative, and humble soul could have had the vision and drive to accomplish such a magnificent work as your film, The Oath. You were exactly the right age and had the right physique and the right look as well as the right mannerisms to pull off your portrayal of Moroni. Your background (such as your role in Ephraim's Rescue) and working with top professionals obviously helped you prepare and helped you get the connections needed to be successful.

When the man (I forgot his name) who gave Handel the Bible verses that formed the libreto for Handel's ""Messiah"" witnessed the completed production, he told George Frederick Handel that he ""made very good entertainment out of it"". Handel responded that he'd be very disappointed ""if I only entertained them. I intended to make them better."" Congratulations on making a film that makes us want to be better—while entertaining us profoundly. Congratulations on a gargantuan work of art so well done! Love it.  True to the story. A lot of the movie is made up to help the story along but that's not a bad thing. Amazing movie... Loved it The story is fictional and very creative.  The music and message are powerful, and the acting is believable and well done.  This is an unconventional movie, and of much higher quality morally than most of what is out there.  We saw it twice! :) I wanted to like this film so bad. I even donated to the cause. It was slow, boring and anticlimactic. It felt like it was trying too hard. Marriage was portrayed as a cheap thing that anyone can do just by speaking words to each other. Disappointed. Why does this whole thing now remind me of “the emperor’s new clothes?” It seems like nobody close to Darin wants to be brave and tell him the truth about this film. It seems like everyone is afraid to criticize it because the perceived wisdom is that just because Darin is a good guy, no one should offer any rebuttal. I really enjoyed this movie! A Great storyline to fill in the gaps of history. It told a story of Love, dedication, sacrifice, and devotion in something bigger than self. I will watch it again to see what I missed the first time. I have been waiting for this movie for so long and I was curious to see if it could live up to the expectations. I was pleasantly surprised and loved everything about it. Powerful book and powerful message. I thought the Oath was way better than the SHIFT which we ere also excited to see but was not that great. The Oath was GREAT! Unexpected, I loved it! They need to make more like this.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ They made it sound like it was based on a true story. It was more like a rewritten Gladiator and then they tried to make more sales using the same approach as The Sound of Freedom. They could have and should have just not made any connection to the Book of Mormon and it would have been a lot better. This movie was terrible.  I even helped by donating money to get it made.  It was weird, boring, and the storyline was very off from any historical facts from what the Book of Mormon teaches.  I was disappointed and wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time or money on this. We very much enjoyed the movie - ""The Oath"" exceeded our expectations!  Great scenery, excellent story with action to accentuate the narrative.  Must see! Close, but no cigar.  Am very familiar with the story.  The Book of Mormon is a treasure trove of great material, all uplifting.  A better writer, maybe a different setting. Darin tried to do everything himself, and failed.  
Hope someone keeps trying. This is clearly a historical fiction. Of course this takes some creative liberty with the love story, which initially made me a little uncomfortable, but I can see why he took this approach. Given Moroni was alone at the end of the Nephite era, this was a unique way to try to tell his story as who else would he talk to? I would have liked to see more of the historical context, but this take does do a pretty decent job of representing the character of Moroni and enough reference to portray the brutality of the time. I think a perfectly accurate portrayal of the Book of Mormon would be rated R for violence, but I think this depiction was tastefully done to give the idea but keep it family friendly. Great music and pretty good acting and cinematography for a lower budget film. The show was very well done. I liked the way It showed that a prophet could face the temptations the natural man and still uphold his promises. So so so so bad. It was incredibly boring, and felt inappropriate and sacrilegious at times. The acting was terrible, and you can tell that the director (who is also the writer and main actor) was trying really hard to make this a deep and moving movie. All of it felt forced, and uninspiring. I honestly wish we would have left the theater early. But we both love the Book of Mormon, and kept holding onto hope that it'd get better.  My husband and I left with an empty feeling inside. We had to go home and watch something else to lift our spirits. The only thing that was decent was the music. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time and money. Beautiful cinematography and an interesting story line. I hope that more movies of this caliber are produced in the future."
Drama,radical,"A film that celebrates a dynamic, unconventional teacher who gets great results from his lucky students, telling a story that has its heart in exactly the right place This uplifting movie, written and directed by New York-based filmmaker Christopher Zalla, is a potent reminder that we should never give up on children, because to do so is to give up on the future. Inspired by an actual teacher, film-maker Christopher Zalla’s blast of sunshine leans heavily on earnest overdrive.  It never falls into sentimentality but manages to be moving. [Full review in Spanish] Eugenio Derbez is equally yoked straddling comedy and drama.  The depths he rides through in ""Radical"" prove there is more beyond the surface than what meets the eye with this brilliant, underestimated artist. The film raises questions about various aspects within the field of education, urging us to reflect on the potential that each person carries within themselves, and the importance of discovering and implementing it. [Full review in Spanish] A perfect example of what a skillful, talented filmmaker, working from a sturdy script, a granular-specific setting... can do to elevate that formula into something altogether memorable and moving. Whether in a starring role or a supporting role Eugnio Derbez is always fascinating to watch. His role as an innovative teacher in this film is one of his best. The heart-warming true story is inspirational and relevant, and Eugenio Derbez delivers a powerful performance.

 ""...hardly radical filmmaking. But like teaching, if it reaches just one struggling student or one burned-out teacher, the film argues, it could well change the world."" They've had two hours in this slow, formulaic and manipulative film to make their point. But as much slack as we cut them for their sweet, well-intentioned ""hearts are in the right place"" effort, they don't quite manage it. Radical tells an impactful story about how inspiration can be found in unorthodox ways. Credible performances elevate this drama, which is based on real people — even when there's a familiar formula about a charismatic teacher who changes students' lives. The students are not child actors plucked from agencies, but genuine locals. Derbez’s interactions are thus charged with a special enthusiasm. Everyone feels real, because they are, and we genuinely feel for everyone involved. We should embrace Radical’s humanistic approach, which focuses on overriding negative stereotypes and outlooks. The result is a story that’s beautifully moving. Thanks to credible child actors and a not-so-funny Eugenio Derbez, the true story of Sergio Juárez Correa precisely reaches our hearts. [Full review in Spanish] Radical is a feel-good movie that earns its uplift, rather than force-feeding the desired emotional responses. Viewers' attention is held throughout by a story that combines funny moments with very touching ones. Eugenio Derbez offers his best work yet in this inspiring and wonderful true story film. [Full review in Spanish] You’ve seen this movie before; you probably won’t mind seeing it again. Eugenio Derbez is simply extraordinary in the lead role.","you’ve seen this story told many times before, but the heart within this specific one makes up for any of those comparisons. Radical is an uplifting and inspirational story about a radical teacher and his aspiring students. Based on a true story, it's set in 2011 in a small Mexican coastal town. The town is blighted by poverty and drug violence. Sergio Juarez is a new teacher at the local elementary school, a school that is run down and lacking facilities. Teachers are more interested in test scores rather than inspiring their students. Juarez wants to shake things up and seeks ways to get his students excited about studying. He uses experiments that enable the students. He promotes independent thought, getting great results, even if his methods upset the faculty. Two students in particular flourish under him. Nico, who has fallen under the influence of local drug gangs, and Paloma a young girl who is interested in astrophysics and has genius level qualities. This is quite an inspiring film that hits hard emotionally. It's a feel good story, but more than that it feels like an important film. I knew this was a feel good movie when I went to see Radical but it had good ratings so gave it a chance. It was very standard in the storyline, it seemed straight out of a 'feel good movie' manual. They totally overdid it with dramatic music, too many crying people and over the top winks and facial expressions. The 'feel good' part annoyed me so much that it left a bad aftertaste and did not make me 'feel good' at all. It was more a movie for children than for adults. I think the writers only had one goal, win prizes with sentimental claptrap. If they wouldn't have laid it on so thick I would have enjoyed it much more and given it 3 or 3,5 stars. Radical, a thought-provoking drama based on a true story, tackles the daunting task of education in a Mexican border town beset by poverty, corruption, and gang violence. Eugenio Derbez sheds his usual comedic persona to play Sergio Juarez, a passionate new teacher assigned to a struggling elementary school. The jaded students, used to rote memorisation and a broken system, are a far cry from the enthusiastic learners Sergio dreams of. Determined to make a difference, he throws out the textbook and embarks on a radical experiment, fostering curiosity and critical thinking through unconventional methods—at least for these students.

The film shines when it delves into the human stories. We see the spark of potential ignite in the eyes of Sergio's students. The camaraderie between Sergio and the school's disillusioned principal, Chucho (Daniel Haddad), is another highlight. Their shared love for education, despite their contrasting approaches, is beautifully portrayed. However, the film occasionally falls into sentimentality, skirting over the complexities of systemic issues. The corrupt officials and gang violence, while providing context, feel like missed opportunities for deeper exploration. 

Derbez delivers a heartfelt performance, his charisma captivating the audience as Sergio relentlessly pushes his students. The child actors, all seemingly newcomers, are equally impressive, portraying the vulnerability and resilience of children grappling with a harsh reality. The film's heart lies in these classroom moments, where Sergio's unorthodox methods lead to heartwarming breakthroughs. 

Director Christopher Zalla crafts a visually realistic portrayal of the impoverished town. The muted colour palette underscores the daily struggles, while bursts of life emerge during Sergio's unconventional lessons. The camerawork is unobtrusive, placing the focus squarely on the characters and their interactions. While the editing is mostly seamless, there are occasional pacing issues, particularly in the first half, where the film establishes the setting and characters. 

I do not think Radical is perfect. The feel-good moments, while genuine, can feel a tad unearned at times. The film would have benefited from a deeper dive into the challenges Sergio faces from the sceptical community and the education board.

However, at its core, Radical is a powerful testament to the transformative power of a dedicated teacher. The film's message that every child, no matter their family's financial situation, has incredible potential will linger with you long after you finish watching it. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of a truly great film, Radical is ultimately a rewarding watch, particularly for those who believe in the power of education to change lives. So, if you're looking for a film that's both heartwarming and thought-provoking, Radical is definitely worth a watch. Just be prepared for a ride that's more inspiring than it is nuanced. One of the couple movies you see talking about problems people don't see. This was a beautiful movie. Made me cry. Again, Eugenio D. makes a perfect touch to it. Una hermosa pelicula de niños en la escuela que he visto, mi favorita. Fascinating story based on real events, within a Latin American reality the size of a cathedral, but which is invisible to a world immersed in staring at its own navel. It is always inspiring and refreshing to remember how a single person, just one, determined to do the right thing and with values, can have an impact and create waves that transcend all barriers. Pero que gran película mexicana que vi Radical sin ningún tapujo ni sutileza empieza de una manera enérgica con un Eugenio Derbez  interpretando a un maestro que decide impartir clase de una manera poco ortodoxa, en México, en un pequeño pueblo, en donde el Cartel del Golfo desde chavos inducen a su séquito del crimen organizado, pero ese no es el punto… ¿o si? Más o menos; los tres protagonistas infantiles logran inyectar de vitalidad junto a unnserio y contenido Eugenio Derbez que sigue en su lucha por ser tomado en serio y, hay que decirlo, lo está logrando. Definitivamente me hubiera gustado ver una serie de televisión que pudiera desmenuzar a detalle las precariedades de algunos de los personajes junto al optimismo incesante del maestro Juárez (Derbez) ya que la cinta se siente algo apresurada de tal forma que cuando llega el punto en donde quiere sacarnos el ""lagrimazo"" al puro estilo de No Se Aceptan Devoluciones, no lo logra del todo; aún así, esta cinta logra algo que muchas producciones mexicanas poco a poco están visibilizando y que es super importante: proponer sin importar lo Radical que sea tu idea. Muy buena una de las Mejores película!! Es una muy buena pagina y tiene toda clase de películas Tiene un nivel de análisis profundo Muy buena película para disfrutar en familia. Gran actor Don Eugenio demostrando que además de humor sabe acoplarse a cualquier tipo de interpretación como está de un profesor maravilloso que quisiéramos tener hoy en día para las nuevas generaciones Takes a smart and courageous teacher to think and teach outside the box by focusing on what student's want to learn and figuring out how to connect it back to what is expected to be learned.  Wonderfully inspirational like Stand and Deliver! Es la típica historia del ""profesor raro"" que llega a ""cambiar"" a sus alumnos, con un guión que ralla en lo ridículo, es una película que intenta a la fuerza conmover a la audiencia que clichés, es todo lo que puedes esperar de una película de Eugenio Derbez. Me arrepentí de pagar para verla It's one of those movies you have to sit and watch all the credits, reflecting on the radical love while your heart sinks into a well of sadness. Loved it ! It was sad with a little humor , but the story line was excellent. I will watch it again As a teacher, Sergio is all I want to be. Estupenda! Fenomenal! Motivadora!!"
Drama,scrapper_2023,"Scrapper is about opening up and how a girl who is so steadfastly independent learns it is okay to need someone. Yet Charlotte Regan adds fun and inventiveness to this, creating a kitchen sink drama with a modern visual style. The movie leads us to reflect on aspects related to parenting, the responsibility of young people who become parents without much thought, and the effects of forced maturity on children obliged to work even at school age. [Full review in Spanish] There were a lot of wonderful moments throughout and I look forward to seeing what this young director does next. The Xavier Dolan-esque jump cuts and the intersecting video game sequences are a (satisfying) distraction from the heart of the film, but they are still enjoyable to watch. Charlotte Regan’s Scrapper features an absolute knockout debut performance from Lola Campbell as Georgie The movie's secret weapon is its leading duo: an old soul trapped in a young girl's body and a 30-year-old who's a teen at heart. It's a potentially flammable combination sustained by an effortless chemistry between Campbell and Dickinson. Downbeat but uplifting. [Scrapper] finds some fascinating things to tell, and is charming in its form and conclusion, thus launching the career of a director who may have many more things to say. [Full review in Spanish] Charlotte Regan delves with delicacy and humor, without avoiding the dramatic aspects, into the clumsy but sincere relationship between a girl and her absent father... [Full review in Spanish] Amidst all the intentional artificiality of the filmmaking, [Campbell and Dickinson's] largely improvised interactions never ring false — a dynamic that’s crucial to making the movie feel genuinely touching and real rather than saccharine and shallow.  There is community and light to spare for some new (and nice) angry young people. [Full review in Spanish] Scrapper is constantly animated by a spirit of fun, as if Regan and her team couldn’t bring themselves to dwell too long on the sad bits. Scrapper refuses to be pigeonholed as another dreary story about working-class life. Grief has hope, youth holds the keys to everything. Scrapper director Charlotte Regan, who hails from this working-class London milieu, effortlessly captures how the community wildly crisscrosses in the shared spaces around their pastel, candy-colored flats. Director Charlotte Regan handles these matters with a candy-colored levity that can quite often be charming, in a whimsical, Wes Anderson way, but sometimes just plain baffling. A really remarkable directorial debut. It's a quirky, weird, delightful and offbeat film.  Think of it as the bastard offspring of Charlotte Wells’s Aftersun and Sean Baker’s The Florida Project, with a little Wes Anderson thrown into the mix... Even as it heads exactly where you’re expecting, her simple story grows just as likable and touching as it intends. Scrapper has the charm to burst through the coldest of hearts and win you over with whimsy, bants and working class joy. A poignant tale of rediscovery. Dickinson & newcomer Campbell shine in this gritty, yet heartwarming father-daughter narrative. A testament to resilience, growth, and the ties that bind.","a somewhat familiar coming of age story revitalized with a unique style, voice and perspective. Implausible conceit, juvenile writing & filmmaking and just plain offensive towards working-class kids and parents, along with teachers and social services.

God bless british independent cinema, but surely it doesn't have to be this dumb and cloying? also Dickinson has never starred in a single decent movie, and this is just an AFTERSUN reject without the cinematic prowess , ambition and storytelling power that Charlotte Wells brings to the table. One to seriously avoid. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't understand much of the dialogue. We rented it from a streaming service and had turned on CC but apparently there was no closed caption available. I blame that on cheap production. Too bad. Predictable but there is a touching resolution that feels earned. A beautiful film. It paid close attention to character development- it neither felt too long or too short in introducing its characters and their arcs. I have no criticisms whatsoever. Will be recommending this ASAP. Great acting all around. Heart-warming tale that doesn't spare the grit of a lower-class existence. Really enjoyed, excellent story and acting... Very tender movie about dealing with grief. Great acting from some stars of the future. Great !! Typical ""slice of life "" British movie. We loved it!! (Just tobhear the social worker say that Georgie's uncle was ""winston churchill"" and she believed it was worth it!) Well made, well-acted and quite compelling. A fairly low budget takes nothing away from a well-crafted storyline. I am sad to say that I really wanted to like this movie…. Brilliant subject and idea but I found it to be very contrived … I've worked with children in challenging situations similar to this and the vocabulary and script this young actor has been given just does not ring true… disappointed  🤷🏻‍♀️ I loved it such a charming movie I'm not crying, you are....a wonderful movie. Basically its about grief and coping and growing up. But it's still positive and charming. Wonderful. It's a very interesting movie with good acting and storyline. It's definitely worth the watch. The movie becomes interesting when the father shows up. It is a little dull before that time, and glorifying child thief and bicycle thief is not funny either. Funny, endearing, authentic. Terribly sweet. Slow moving, but well worth the time spent. Touching story of a kid who loses her mom only to have a unexpected dad appear This movie was a wonderful surprise.  It was billed as a comedy ... I cried my eyes out. A beautifully told and shot movie about grief It's a wonderful movie.  The happy ending may not be realistic, but harsh reality is not for everyone."
Drama,fallen_leaves,"The film exudes a quiet sorrowfulness that informs every plot beat and every visual choice. The fleeting beauty of temporal happiness is no less beautiful. That’s the poetic heartbeat of Aki Kaurismäki’s latest film, Fallen Leaves However understated, Kaurismaki’s film also offers a warm love story about two lonely people, one alcoholic, struggling to break out of their dead-end lives. ... No matter how bleak life can be, Kaurismaki suggests, there is hope. One of 2023's 20 best films. Kaurismaki emphasizes human resilience and the value of love with his filmmaking gestures, in an absolutely gorgeous and hugely affirming love story. It’s one of those pure delights that’s hard to resist. An odd couple story seasoned with playful inconsistencies and deadpan humour that brings,  or appears to bring, unlikely lovers together in an out-of-kilter society In any case, it is an interesting film that deserves to be seen for its unconventional style and its audiovisual features. [Full review in Spanish] Just like in his previous works, the director employs a subtle and, ultimately, poetic humor, with stoic and distant characters who nonetheless manage to captivate our sensitivity [Full review in Spanish] By design, Fallen Leaves isn’t so much a romance as a series of gestures towards the idea of one. You can’t tell this kind of story any more, is the implication, but wouldn’t it be nice if you could? Nobody speaks unless they have to, although there is a wealth of wordless communication. At a time when movies seem to be getting longer and longer, Kaurismäki keeps everything under 90 minutes. Thoroughly boring...An arthouse sedative. This movie does follow that arc in its own way. It feels like there’s a big beating heart awaiting its moment. In paying homage to Finnish culture, Fallen Leaves might prove to be a valedictory statement from one of the world's great auteurs. Like all great films, Fallen Leaves makes us ponder deeply our philosophy of life. This quietly funny and endearingly gruff movie keeps you hoping our two would-be lovers will be together by the time the final credits roll. Wonderful stuff. While sad songs punctuate and homages to many great romantic films where two would be lovers are separated and need to find their ways to one another play out, the Finnish master makes room in our darkest times for us to smile, even for a short while.  The drabness of low-rung lives is sautéed reindeer and mashed potatoes to Finnish film-maker Aki Kaurismäki. Fallen Leaves drops its couple into a place that includes hope and makes for an oddly nice film, one that mixes grim reality with optimistic acceptance. Perhaps what is most gratifying about Kaurismäki’s work is the way that he is able to balance his po-faced ironic tone with a genuine, and acutely tender, melancholy. The occasional jokes are as funny as they are deadpan. The little gestures and touches of affection between the characters are both plausible and endearing. There is no straining for effect, but it lifts your mood by osmosis. Restrained but radiant, Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismäki's Cannes hit is an achingly romantic drama about two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl.","I have watched this film at cinema club this evening. I thought it was poor.  I wouldn't want to go to Finland if that's what it's like. Depressing from start to finish. Though I was engaged by the lead actors, I found the  stylized approach to all characters in the movie irritating. There’s deadpanned and then there’s stilted. Everyone acts as if revealing some warmth or cracking half a smile will cause an explosion. Beautiful work of art, best movie I have seen in years When love is missing from your life, addictions and self-sabotage creep in. Simple plot not original,  but time passes smoothly enough.  
Finish people really this dour? Is said to be happiest country on earth. 
Seriously? Continuing in his trademark of minimalist filmmaking, deadpan humour and his fondness for retro, Aki Kaurismäki crafts a romantic tragicomedy about two lonely proletariats meeting cute in a karaoke bar and tumbles into a clumsy pursuit of love so simply told, it endears with a timeless nostalgia. Often hilarious and the movie has own unique style (anachronisms coupled with a serious love of classic cinema). The two leads are absolutely perfect. Kaurismäki delivers as always Another amazing work from Finnish Filmmaker Aki Kaurismäki Might be the worst movie I have ever seen. I felt like I was watching the college thesis from a C- film student. The lighting was horrible. The story was boring. The characters have no depth. The filmmaker gives us no reason to care. The positive reviews from the critics are mind-blowing. How could anyone actually enjoy this? There is nothing about it that is interesting at all. Good film, unusual humor, slow paced. You might think of it as a Finnish version of Marty-two characters with not much going for them think that being together will make things better. Hope they are right. A staple of Finnishness. Be prepared for awkward silences. Very slow burner ,and not very satisfying.
Not a smile in sight .No energy ! Original, well-rounded story of love in poverty Thought it was a polish movie for the entire time… kaurismäkii doesn't disappoint, this is brilliant on many levels ""Fallen Leaves"" is short and sweet. This movie has enough of a positive vibe with some quirky humor to make it a unique watch. I feel like I was more invested in the movie in the first half and because it doesn't run for that long, I felt like it could have been longer and deeper. I liked everything presented here and think it is a technically well-made film, I just finished it wanting more than what was on the surface. Overall, it is a good movie that means well which left me with a positive feeling and celebrates the connections between everyday people which is something I can ultimately support and get behind. Wow! Wonderfully quirky. You'll either love it or not get it. Deadpan, dour beauty and silence used to great effect. It's slow paced yet you get drawn in. A Finnish tragicomedy romance where hope exists despite tough personal battles and depressing world issues. 
The soundtrack builds engagement and forms part of the storytelling. The song ""Born with sadness and clothed in disappointment"" captures the mood. very enjoyable and warm and funny, highly recommended Beautifully raw love story with deeply human undercurrents. Music and songs spot on (even Maustetytöt). I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who's seen downsides of life, and therefore respects even little sparks of light, here and there."
Drama,the_marsh_kings_daughter,"While the exploration of the characters' identity follows trodden paths and is quite literal in psychological terms, the movie manages to deliver an effective story about survival instincts... [Full review in Spanish] It's mildly enthralling, I mean there is a lot that works, but unfortunately the filmmakers couldn't quite nail the ending, which is too bad.  Ridley delivers her strongest post-Star Wars turn with a deeply empathetic character who is, throughout the drama, on the cusp of a breakdown, or a breakthrough. It’s powerful work. A strange misfire. Neil Burger does a good job with the film's pace and in shepherding strong performances from his whole cast, especially Prince as the young Helena. What I appreciated about this movie was how it captured trauma and selective memory. The movie could have been a meaningful study of trauma. Instead, it gives in to the mechanics of a cat-and-mouse pursuit. For a while, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” feels as though it may be heading somewhere truly interesting, but, instead, it becomes a bit waterlogged. I was sitting back in my seat, nowhere near the edge of it. I would have liked to have inched towards the edge of it.  This is a very suspenseful film, at times unpleasantly so.  It's ironic that much of The Marsh King's Daughter takes place in a backwoods marsh area, because this entire movie is a soggy mess. It starts off as a monotonous drama and devolves into a series of silly action scenes that don't look believable. Ridley feels challenged in the right ways, while Mendelsohn channels another scummy character to strong effect. The stakes are just high enough to have kept me involved, and that’s fine for a decent paperback come-to-life situation. There’s nothing especially surprising about the way the film wraps up, but it still packs a mild punch, thanks to Ridley’s cold stare, borne of childhood trauma. A potent premise and earnest performances from Daisy Ridley and Ben Mendelsohn are let down by an under-written screenplay that submits to the temptations of its genre. The tale is too tame, its savagery held too much in check to truly hold the audience in its thrall. It might make for a better book but The Marsh King’s Daughter is a stiff and stuffy thriller, lacking in a tighter script, and any true energy to dig itself out of the mud. While the premise of The Marsh King's Daughter is rich with the possibility for how introspectively deep the story could go, it doesn't manage to get there.  Rather than keeping us guessing or catching us by surprise, the movie goes the more conventional route, leading to an ending that's as far-fetched as it is predictable.  After a promising opening, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” quickly falls into a predictable and monotonous slog, plodding along toward an inevitable confrontation between father and daughter. On the positive side, the acting is good and the atmospheric setting is visually pleasing.","This is a good movie, and a great thriller. It keeps you thinking and wondering throughout the movie. I recommend that you see this film. велике прзчарування. 30 хвилин поровся щоб не заснути- в підсумку вимкнув перегляд і присвятив час прогулянці з дітьми. Нікому не рекомендую This movie is such a predictable one. It uses trope after trope and is incredibly slow paced. It tries to build suspense but fails as that. The acting is pretty okay but some lines are so cliché it’s hard not to cringe. The only interesting part is the premise of the story. I bet boomers really like this one. The movie started off very promising, but suffered from poor to nonexistent backstory/character development. It plodded along very slowly attempting to build suspense but ultimately failed to deliver. The ending was predictable and anticlimactic. This movie was well worth the watch. The way she played her role as a protective mother and wife never letting herself give up!! Just showed the compassion and trama at it's absolute best. It made you feel like you were right there with her just pushing her on. Just watch it!!! Great beginning and ending, struggles to come together in the middle which is disappointing as there is so much in the story to work with. Enjoyable watch non the less, but generally disappointing as you feel with better direction and writing this could have been much more that what it ended up being. Starts off slow but finishes with you on the edge of your seat! I was 10 minutes in, eating my toast and drinking my coffee thinking I was going to watch this to the end, when I realized that the filter used to diffuse the image and the washed out color like it was shot in a mist was not going away. I jumped forward repeatedly thinking this was temporary, but no, it was by design. I don't watch blurry camera work by people who think they are trendy. Idk what people are talking about and still don’t understand how it has such a low rating. Movie was great. Decent concept but slow and very predictable This movie was amazing to watch! I would recommend to viewers who love movies that has very intense scenes and action moments on what they are improvising the story that is happening with characters on their relationship on what they should do or not do from the their past moments. The star power of this film could not save it from being a very slow and boring experience. There is no motivating force for the villain (father) of this story -- it is such a huge stretch as to attain unbelievable status. Ridley was fine, as was everyone else, if we're speaking about performances. One of my biggest pet peeves in movies is how easy it is to find a single person in an area that covers thousands upon thousands of acres, and yes, this movie commits that sin. This movie has a lot of smart story elements to tell, but it never quite goes there, both in story or direction, and everything it sets up just tends to fall a little flat. That said, I still enjoyed the film but I didn't finish still thinking about it, which I know I could have with a stronger script. I think it's obvious that the makers of this movie had a completely different storyline than the book in mind. I think the books story was much more compelling and a lot less slow. With that being said I think the acting was great. I think There was opportunity for really strong performances. I don't think it got enough marketing and I think the lack of good ratings comes from not enough character development while being slow at the same time. This movie was awful. Go read the book. It's incredible. The movie does not follow the book hardly at all. Really enjoyed Daisy and her character's struggle. Bit slow and predictable in the end, but didn't mind. Beautiful scenery, very suspenseful despite is slow.  Always kept me rivited and wondering whats next.  In spite of other commentary, I found the story to be easy to follow.  I also found the acting to be really good.   I will remember this movie!! Daisy needs to keep making movies like this to get away from Rey's shadow. She is an amazing actress, but her talent is ruined by Disney Star Wars' horrible writers. Wouldn't classify it as a thriller. Not action packed. Just a great story that unfolds bit by bit. About a young girl who grows up to see her father from a different perspective, understanding who he really is and what he really did-using what he taught her as a child to survive his re-entry into her life. 
Worth the watch. Its slow paced, but engaging. Gorgeous cinematography and I can't fault the cast. Daisy and the child actor for her youth are perfect. You feel with them as their story unveils.

Beautiful cyclic stories that round out the lessons of youth repeating with the knowledge of an adult.

I actually really enjoyed this watch. It's nothing groundbreaking but it's well worth a watch.

The beautiful side shots of the marshes at the end are breathtaking with the wind flowing through the reeds that matches the mood of the closing scenes."
Drama,the_road_dance,"A serendipity of a movie with twists and turns I absolutely did not see coming. Essentially a period tearjerker about a woman’s resilience in the face of tragedy, but an evocative, emotionally effective one, anchored by a powerful lead performance by Hermione Corfield.  A small beauty, old-fashioned in emotion and technique, a pocket epic shot in the 4:3 Academy ratio of the earliest feature films. The storytelling is old-fashioned, but its raptures dear; the landscapes are timeless. Hopeful, it sweeps, even soars. Carrying most of the burden is Corfield, who is outstanding.  The actor channels Kirsty’s despair in a way that cuts straight to your heart. You simply can’t take your eyes off her, her conviction in the role a force to be reckoned with.  We’re left with the pretty scenery and a free-floating sense of inconsequentiality. Scottish Gothic-romantic entry boasts fine lead turn by Hermione Corfield and sweeping novelistic detail. Strong performances and striking visuals elevate this true-life Scottish melodrama above its narrative conventions. ... committed acting performances, particularly by the primary trio of Corfield, Morven Christie, and Ali Fumiko Whitney (the latter as Kirsty’s mother and sister), elevate this film far beyond what the rather mundane scripting gives them to work with. An old-fashioned melodrama, The Road Dance isn't quite up to the task of tackling the severity of the traumatic event at its core. The result has neither the full force of realism nor the emotional pleasures of melodrama; what it most calls to mind is something seen and half-forgotten on PBS. A standard period drama that arrives at hard truths with a hammy delivery. “The Road Dance” is well worth a turn on the dance floor, delivering nicely on the time you invest in these characters and their situation. However, what unfolds in The Road Dance is an engaging, beautifully filmed, and intimately acted tale of trauma, grief, resilience, and hope. The commanding sense of place is most memorable in this naturalistic story of female bonding, a sweeping, sensitive melodrama about the consequences of a single violent act in a remote community … a handsome production that is striving for an emotionality that it cannot deliver because it fails to utterly commit to the protagonist. Photographed in the old-fashioned pre-wide-screen 3 x 4 ratio, the film is simple but, in its small way, quite memorable. The Road Dance is elevated by the simply stunning turns of both Fletcher and Corfield, the latter especially grand in the type of performance that feels as if we’re watching an actress just before she breaks through to public awareness. ... You can forgive the cliches because their implausibilities are overshadowed by the craggy grandeur of the island itself, with its huddled stone cottages and the closeness of those who dwell in them. The Road Dance is a sweeping epic of a type we don't see much of any more. …if you can handle the subject, then The Road Dance has enough good acting and narrative energy to make for a fairly gripping entertainment…","Very good movie. It has 2 surprises near the end, and at the end, that you will not expect! I recommend this movie. This movie restored my faith in cinema.  This has everything a good story should and I wish there were more out there like it- we loved it! A sad, tragic, yet beautifully told story about a traumatic incident in a small Scottish community. Great cinematography, all the actors had chemistry with eachother so it felt more realistic. This is a beautiful movie in every sense.
The cinematography, acting, scenery!
A story of love and tragedy that is both emotionally challenging and heart rendering throughout!! A gripping drama set in the pre WW1 period where young men and women were facing many terrors of war.  Entwined in that setting is a poignant story of a lovely young lady, in the prime of life, struck by love then loss.  The story was gripping.  The theme relates to many social questions today.  Not just a chick flick...I am an old man and enjoyed the movie tremendously. Beautiful film of love and tragedy in a small village in Scotland during the First World War. A must see for anyone who loves period films.  Stunning scenery and acting under the direction of Richie Adams. Very sad but ended very good. Great movie. There is no doubt... THE ROAD DANCE by Richie Adams is an instant cinema masterpiece! My wife and I laughed, cried, and mourned along with the characters as we sat spellbound by the finely tuned, smoothly unfolding epic story. Financers should be lining up to back Richie Adams next film! Clint and Lisa McCowen This movie was wonderful!  A touchingly beautiful tale.  The musical score and the photography was lovely!  A hidden gem! Absolutely brilliant. Engaging from start to finish with a proper sting in the tail. I love a movie like this that just draws you in and you are wondering each moment where it's leading. Beautifully filmed and acted. Captivating story with a few twists. If watching at home turn on the subtitles for several of the characters with heavy accents. Well worth watching in a theatre though given the incredible scenery. I thought the movie was really good and I loved watching it a cinephile's delight, intense story, sublime landscapes, a tour de force of reconstruction of the life of the perfect era, actors at the top
will certainly remain one of my pleasure cine films 2023 Very moving story. Makes excellent use of the local and coastal seascapes.
Watch for the human interaction. This isn't a historical-accurate film, but a human-story film.

Utterly outstanding performance by the lead actress. Amazing cinematography, setting and costumes let down by a loosely constructed storyline and ill-fitting script. This movie could have been so much better. Loved it. Very emotional. Great photography in a most interesting setting This was such a surprise - I watched it on a flight and I'm so glad I did! Not very uplifting. The characters didn't relate that well to each other. Gaps in the storyline and a glossy ending. I had wanted to like it, but it's not how it turned out. Beautifully crafted film that handles some quite difficult themes very well. Wonderful performances all round, especially by Hermione Corfield who is absolutely captivating in the lead role. Wow, what a wonderful heartfelt amazingly acted movie  just wow"
Drama,the_three_musketeers_part_i_dartagnan,"Although he virtually invented the potboiler, Dumas’s books have a panache that distinguishes them from those lifeless popular squibs written to a formula. The casting is inspired, especially when it comes to the Musketeers.  The umpteenth adaptation of an 180-year-old classic is rife with machismo writ large. The dynamically dashing nature of the action scenes live up to the swashbuckling standards many will be expecting. The umpteenth movie adaptation of Alexandre Dumas’s classic 1844 novel gets a good, if stern, going over in a handsomely costumed production. Extravagantly expensive, action heavy – the films are exactly what they claim to be – blockbuster cinema. This film is gorgeously shot by cinematographer Nicolas Bolduc. It opens with a take-no-prisoners fight in the rain and mud that includes D’Artagnan and Milady and sets the scene for all that is to follow.  It almost resembles a spaghetti western over how authentically all the ornate 17th-century finery is encrusted with filth. Compared to recent blockbuster attempts, an unmistakable edge is achieved here. Though one can question some of the filmmakers’ decisions, generally they pull off the attempt to revivify Dumas’ flavorful swashbuckler for modern audiences.  It is romantic in the classic sense of the word. These characters have values, and although the film is frequently funny, it never sneers at honor or chivalry. When Athos announces he would rather die than betray his King, we believe him.  D’Artagnan proves itself a highly worthy contestant amongst its predecessors, shining with exemplary visual craft, writing and acting. What this installment energetically proves is that you can ruffle the feathers of a totemic tale and still capture what’s good, galloping fun in Dumas’ storytelling. THE THREE MUSKETEERS: D’ARTAGNAN tells the first half of the story, and is the first from France in decades, filled with sword fights and palace intrigue, but never losing sight of the characters amidst all of the swashbuckling. Dumas was a master of the serial form, and this version of “The Three Musketeers” manages to preserve that thrill-to-thrill sensation. Slick and stylish, this latest cinematic adaptation of the venerable adventure saga hardly breaks any new ground, but it showcases a strong cast and some exciting action sequences. It helps that the cast is excellent, the production design exquisite, and the camera appropriately frenetic. These musketeers have panache, and I am all here for it. ...a real old-fashioned swashbuckler, full of sword fights, handsome men and pretty ladies, improbably accurate gunplay (with smoothbore weapons!), stunning locations, candlelit interiors, wild stunts... The machinations of the French court, its enemies and protectors, wide network of spies and the Three Musketeers’ derring-do bring Dumas’ novel to vivid life.
 The Three Musketeers: Part I – D'Artagnan recalls a different, older type of filmmaking, and it's fun and exciting, too. The production values are exquisite, the cinematography gorgeous and the fighting sequences exciting. It’s on a par with Richard Lester’s 1972 version, and that is saying something.","For anyone familiar with these characters and the story, the casting is perfection. Yes, that is D'Artagnan! Yes, that's Athos! And Porthos! And Aramis! And Constance! and so on. The portrayals are not one-note, but capture each character's complexity (including the king). It's so appropriate for it to be a French production. Great production values. Ravishing costumes and sets. And fascinating juxtaposition of swordplay and gunfire (how do they choose?) as the latter will eventually supplant the former.
We got the Part I DVD from the library and now have Part II (Milady) to watch. Hooray! There are some frustrating American franchise filmmaking choices (shaky cam single takes, mid credit teasers, etc.) but this thing moves at a brisk pace while never feeling rushed. Holaa... The plot is not well-organized, lacks detail, and seems rushed. On the positive side, the film has good visual and each actor has a strong character. lots of swash, the right amount of buckle, so much derring and the right amount of do. Vincent Cassell wins most handsome man award - again ! Ladies rather nice too. EIN KRIMI MIT MANTEL UND DEGEN

Es ist Jahr 1627, Frankreich ist gespalten durch einen Religionskrieg. Ein junger Mann namens D'Artagnan wünscht sich nichts sehnlicher als ein Musketier zu werden. Als er die drei legendären Musketiere Athos, Porthos und Aramis kennenlernt verändert sich sein Leben. Zusammen müssen sie nicht nur König Luis XIII beschützen, sondern ein Anschlag, was das gesamte Königreich in seinem Grundfesten erschüttern würde, muss verhindert werden.

Dieser Film geht ca. 121 Minuten und ist ab 12 Jahren freigegeben. Wir haben hier Version Nummer Schieß mich Tod der drei Musketiere, zumindest den ersten Teil. Der zweite Teil erwartet uns dann im Dezember und ich muss sagen, ich freue mich drauf. Die zwei Stunden hab ich persönlich gar nicht gemerkt, da die Geschichte fast wie ein Krimi aufgebaut ist in dem Hinweise oder Gegenstände gesucht werden müssen. Die Figuren sind alle sympathisch, angefangen bei D'Artagnan der quasi in die Musketiere reinstolpert, über die Musketiere selbst die alle ihren eigenen Witz haben aber auch jeder sein Päckchen hat. Bis hin zu den Bösewichten rund um Eva Greens Figur, deren Mythos noch offenbleibt. Was einen allerdings rausreißt aus dieser dreckig schönen Welt (übrigens nix CGI, alles an richtigen Drehorten gefilmt) ist die Action. Entweder ist es zu dunkel, die Kamera ist viel zu nah dran oder alles ist verwackelt. Teilweise bekommst Kopfschmerzen wenn man da länger zu sieht, dabei gibt es einige Longtakes die echt richtig geil hätten werden können.
Am Ende bleibt ein spannender erster Teil, der Lust auf einen zweiten macht. Schausplätze, Schauspieler und Story überzeugen ohne Probleme. Action und Kameraarbeit lassen jedoch sehr zu wünschen übrig.

Von mir bekommt der Film 7,5/10 Punkten. Erklärtext am Anfang erzählt uns was los ist, faule Art die Story zu beginnen. Wenn ich lesen will nehme ich ein Buch und schaue keinen Film. Best version of the French classic. Everything (except a rather recent looking umbrella) was authentic and staged wonderfully. Time flew and plenty of the intrigue and suspense of the original work. It's okay I mean the set pieces are awesome because it feels like you're in France during that time but then you have guys that are like the king who doesn't come off as being a king or a cardinal Richelieu who doesn't come across as an arrogant bad guy.. but the main musketeers Athos porthos and aramis seem like they're trying too hard to make us believe their friends when they're supposed to be friends Mediocre film, one of the worst versions of the 3 Musketeers brought to the cinema. It wants to be deep, but it fails in the romance, it fails in the chemistry between its main characters, it fails in making its protagonist a relevant icon. My opinion the cast was absolutely wrong. Vincent should play Cardinal Richelieu. Porthos should to be a bigger actor. All 3 Musketeers not recognizable during whole movie. Takes a few sec to understand who is who….

Only Eva Greene role was absolute amazing. 
Scenes and action were great too. There was a collective groan in the cinema from all the secondary school French students as those fateful three words ""To be continued"" appeared at the end of the movie.  Entirely engaging, the French have no shortage of wonderful historical venues for their films, and what they save on locations helps cross-subsidise the lavish costumes.  The three Musketeers, to be joined by the fourth, D'Artagnon, were as swashbuckling and likeable as you could hope for. Lots of intrigue, religious dissension, a bit of romance.  And on the way home I had to buy myself a ticket to the sequel, Milady. As a Dumas devotee this is easily the best three musketeers version produced. You'll love the authenticity of lavish sets and costumes. The beautiful French language is front and centre with subtitles. The cast is stellar and splitting the movie into part 1 and 2 facilitates depth and layers over 200 mins of combined viewing. Don't be deceived this version is no trite setimental panache. The grittiness, colours and cinematography almost leap from the screen in a sensory feast. Interestingly the story line is cleverly interpreted without deviating from the central story line. One reviewer felt the film ‘doesn't break new ground.' Maybe they haven't seen previous versions because this breaks new ground in every way possible while staying true to the genuis of Dumas. For those that haven't read the book I recommend first reading a synopsis to enhance the film experience because the film moves quickly with a massive cast of characters. Finally, the portrayal of all the main characters is exactly as it should be - hats off to everyone associated with this version - scintillating! A historical adventure film with French elegance! Finally, a French movie based on a French book that hasn't been hit with the Hollywood stick. I totally loved the 1973 movie as a kid, as an adult it's just plain silly. The 1993 version with Charlie Sheen, Keifer Sutherland and Chris O'Donnell - wtf?! (insert poop emoji here). Fast forward to 2023 - French actors (mostly) speaking French on set pieces that are absolutely breathtaking makes D'Artagnan the best Musketeers movie that has ever been made. Exciting, and beautiful! I can't wait to see what Eva Green does in the next installment! The way movie's are supposed to be made! Good solid movie! I felt engaged the whole time and enjoyed the characters and dialogue as well. Breathtaking production value. Made me feel like I was actually transported to that period of time. The writing and acting was fantastic as well. Not sure how this movie is not more talked about. Hopefully word will spread quickly. Can't wait for part 2. I have seen so many Musketeer films and series over the years.  This is one that I wish I had not.  It is dire. if you going to redo as movie that has been redone over 40 times, at least try to do a better job then 1/2 of them Me gustó la película, creo que al principio me enredé un poco con los personajes, pero conforme se desarrolló la trama pude identificarlos mejor.
Me encantan que las películas sean habladas en el idioma del país que se desarrollan en este caso francés.
Los vestuarios excelentes las locaciones buenísimas la ambientación, buena historia, buena trama; esperaremos la segunda parte de los 3 mosqueteros. Absolutely brilliant, must see version."
Drama,the_end_we_start_from,"A film that doesn’t feel highly original yet has an urgency about it, manifested into a story of devotion and endurance. Embodying horror and anxiety, yet wearing a dauntless resolve that only a mother fearing for her child’s life can muster, Comer’s performance alone makes the film worth the price of admission. Evoking memories of everything from Children of Men and Spielberg’s War of the Worlds to the 1980s BBC version of The Day of the Triffids, this nightmarish and brilliant near-future-set British drama deserved a far better fate than as an online rental. Comer is exceptional throughout and there are some especially great scenes after her character bonds with a kindred soul, spiritedly played by Katherine Waterston. Jodie Comer's riveting performance is the main reason to watch The End We Start From, an occasionally vague but well-acted survival story about a new mother trying to survive with her baby during an environmental crisis. Destruction spectacle is scarce, yet the cumulative emotional impact is considerable, making this an unusually touching piece of near-future fiction. The ending feels a bit rushed, otherwise, Mahalia Belo’s feature debut manages to stay afloat with memorable performances and a message that motherhood can be way more frightening than Mother Nature. The film’s budget undermines its attempts to depict the rain-lashed country, but ultimately, The End We Start From is about so much more than the disaster; it’s about living through it and prevailing. It's a really strong film. Perhaps a little repetitious... But nevertheless the thoughts and the notions going on here are very moving. Belo's understated approach to the narrative expresses the gift of motherhood and the importance of humanity and unity amidst crisis, led by Comer's immaculate, nuanced performance. This isn’t a movie you just watch, it’s one you feel in your bones.  Alice Birch's script uses long stretches of silence without the need for words, while Mahalia Belo's direction maintains a singular point of view to pull the viewer into the central character's odyssey. The result is moving and strongly involving. A very confident piece of direction from Mahalia Belo. Mahalia Belo’s drama is aimless. But as a tactile, vivid portrait of a new mother facing challenges, it might speak to anyone who has been there, whether or not your experiences happened alongside a wider cataclysm. When the script becomes choppy, especially in the second half, the performances keep the film from getting stuck in the mud. The pace trickles towards the end, and the perpetual watery metaphors such as taps, showers and lakes, are relentless, but Comer will still hold your attention throughout. Alice Birch's screenplay keeps the dialogue extremely spare, and frankly the film is 20 per cent too enigmatic for my liking, but it works as a tale of motherhood in all-too-believably challenging circumstances. This British eco-disaster drama dispenses with genre conventions for an intimate, almost introspective, solitary survival journey. The slow pace and narrative ellipses leave time for viewers to idly wonder where Woman is sourcing food, but it also gives us plenty of opportunities to admire Comer’s skills as an actor and look forward to her next role.  In the eye of the storm is Comer, delivering one gut-punch of raw emotion after another, often without uttering a word. She is truly a force of nature.","The barometer for me with a movie like this is if I'm moved at the end. I was not. It was so slow I skimmed a lot of it. The pace killed almost all the emotion it could have elicited. It’s one of those “non films” 
Left me wondering if there was going to be a twist at the end but there wasn’t Beautifully acted. Too drawn out and a weak ending. Jodie Comer Soley is the reason to see this brief yet impactful film—it is one that you feel distant from yet so understandably close. It is sprinkled with Loss and disbelief in Humanity yet recovered by the Kindred Souls that come together throughout with beautifully displayed friendship. It starts with a feeling of Desolation but ends with a sense of renewal. With the Indie feel of this British film, based on a book, I take away that this is a brilliantly acted and thoughtfully displayed Film. Worst movie I’ve ever seen. Very on trend but let down a bit by logical inconsistencies such as bird at the fire, boat arrival process and strange people. Visuals were okay but the storyline sucked, wanted more from a thriller. I was optimistic seeing the cast, and gave it the benefit of the doubt for a while but soon gave up caring. Waste of the cast and far too many clichés, less suspense than homes under the hammer and ultimately less satisfying. It's a good film. Rather bleak but that's the idea. Jodie Comer is great as always.
It might not be for everyone as the other one star reviews show but just because it's not someone's type of film does not make it a bad one. If you're expecting a disaster film like 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow you will be very disappointed. It wasn't the action packed disaster film that the description leads you to believe, but it is thought provoking and worth a watch. I love how the film doesn't shy away from graphics surrounding giving birth. All very realistic and shows what birth givers go through.
This film portrays how selfish humanity can be and also the kindnesses we do for one another. Only managed 40 mins of this boring 💤 and lacking in everything film. I found myself not caring for any of the characters and wished drowning on them all fast.
Jodie Comer Mmm where was she from? Hard to tell as her accent was all over the place.
Don't waste your time. Tedious no burner. I saw someone describe this as suspenseful and wanted to scream. Rained a bit then people slog along doing nout. Dull and over rated. Perhaps better played backwards, seemed like the longest ever movie, I had to escape it after an hour. Every word of the script was utterly pretentious, meaningless and pointless pollution. To be clear, really really pathetic in every way, complete theft of my time and the rental cost of £1.99 an a visual and audio abuse. It will be a long time before I watch a movie or show again. A beautiful, yet scary and enlightening piece on terror, loss, love and movement.
This shows a picture of what life is already like for some and could become likely for many. 
Jodie Comer is fantastic, and is supported by an excellent cast. Slow, filmed in backw yards and and up close to hide the lack of budget...takes from the acting.
Story bit tenuous. 
Disappointed This was a mesmerising performance by Jodie Comer from start to finish. Apocalyptic floods and the panic and breakdown of life. Received a round of applause at my local cinema, Jodie deserves an award for this. Jodie Comer proving yet again that she's one of the best actresses of this generation. Decent flick. Comer was very good. Good to see more of her. Loved Killing Eve for the most part. The movie reflected the 'everyone for themselves' panic mode human beings pretty well. 
Odd to see Cumberbatch take such a small role. C'mon now, he's great. Waterson was very good as always. 
The movie stayed out of melodrama tendencies in general. But I wasn't very compelled by it all. The desperation was conveyed well at times, but as for the 'mystery' element in the description, I didn't get that. The husband/father character was a real wimp and a deserter. Didn't care for that, but...happens. 
It's good that the running time was about 100 min. I may not have stayed with it had it gone over 2 hrs. 
3 stars Can I put no stars? This movie is terrible , it's about a flood right? Yet it never seems to be raining , so so so boring , so many holes and just all around slow and boring . Don't waste your time A miserable, pretentious and boring film, not helped by Jodie Comer seemingly unable to decide which accent to speak in. A terrible, overrated film."
Drama,the_persian_version,"It’s a noble but flawed look at a culture that nonetheless deserves its time in the spotlight. As The Persian Version flits back and forth between the past and present and between America and Iran, we see how even the slightest change in perspective can allow us to see, perhaps even appreciate, a situation in a whole new light. It’s not perfect, but The Persian Version is a mighty salute to not just Keshavarz’s own mothers, but mothers and women all over the world, fighting for a better future and a better life, regardless of their conditions.  Among the joyous dance sequences and near-farcical moments, The Persian Version digs for emotional truths and finds them. Don’t let the first 15 minutes of this rousing modern melodrama fool you. Maryam Keshavarz’s drama is an astute dissection of mother-daughter discord; it’s perceptive and candid in its insights into the push-pull cultural struggle experienced by second-generation immigrants. Keshavarz cranks up the charm, and the feelgood factor makes it an easy watch – despite some of the gags feeling more suited to a TV sitcom. The generational strike of The Persian Version is something that’s been explored before, to greater effect. However, a fine cast and creative storytelling ensure this is a journey that people from all walks of life can latch on to. Describing itself as ‘a true story – sort of’, The Persian Version blends comedy and family drama to great effect, showing us a good deal more than its heroine and narrator intends us to see. Girls succeed, and fun remains the operating mood for The Persian Version movie. A vibrant comedy that perfectly balances the film’s dramatic overtone with continuous pockets of levity. It’s a story of determination and independence, filled with headstrong female characters overcoming misogynistic prejudice. It's also a lot of fun Though Leila is an engaging and sympathetic character, Shireen’s saga is the more engrossing as she ascends from child bride to enterprising businesswoman and champion to immigrants trying to achieve the American dream.  Once you get past the feeling of wanting more, The Persian Version is a heartwarming -- and often heartbreaking -- exploration of a mother and daughter repairing their future relationship by confronting their past. You can admire writer-director Maryam Keshavarz’s   ambition, but the effect is like watching a juggler trying to keep too many balls in the air at once. Filled with laughter, heart, and excellent work from Layla Mohammadi and Niousha Noor, The Persian Version is a delight to watch. ... recombines familiar themes into a fresh and vibrant package that manages a heartfelt mix of humor and sentiment. A filmmaker who has been around for more than a decade suddenly establishes herself as a bold new comic voice in The Persian Version. I’d welcome more of this (and some more filmmaking discipline) from her and her leading lady. Too many shifts in times, tones, and ideas crowd the earnest intentions. A comedy in bold, candied colors and spirited performances, Maryam Keshavarz’s <I>The Persian Version</I> sings, zings and even stings with cultural specificity... Madcap dashes... rise above the potent danger for a descent into therapeutic digression.  One of the year’s most surprisingly potent small discoveries.","I saw the Persian version and let me start off by saying I’m Persian so I’m completely biased. As an Iranian American, I really enjoyed this movie because it’s something you don’t see often. I’ve seen representation on screen in the past but this was different. I’ve seen movies made for Iranians and I’ve seen Iranians as side characters in tv and film. But this felt like it was for a non Iranian audience. They showed a lot of things that I’ve experienced in my culture, but did it in a way that explains what happened. It felt like the audience was meant to experience what the main character was feeling in real time. There were things I didn’t exactly love and some of the things in the movie were a little over exaggerated, but overall I did like it. a touching story that has some trouble balancing it’s comedic and serious tones.

and i don’t think narration is immediately a bad quality in a film, but there is a lot here. probably too much, in my opinion. Must see movie with great acting and directing. Disrespectful movie about religion and culture Hate Speech against Shia Islam and Imam e Zaman (as). This is very lively and entertaining. I also learned a lot about Iranian culture, in an engaging way. Unexpected and deep story. Beautiful and creative flow. Tight script and very good delivery. Utter disrepect to a religion is not what any movie should do to gain viewers. It shows false theology and gives completely wrong information on love and belief of people. If a movie has to get to down to this to get views, it is utter shame! There is no point watching any part of this movie if the mindset of the director and writer is as such to push anything into the movie without any responsibility.

I wish other viewers understand this and question the movie makers as to why was it needed for them to portray a false theology of the religion to people, and not only a false theology but a mockery on the beliefs of the people.

0 stars for the movie. This movie is completely showing false and distracting young youth and who ever non muslim is watching I would like to say them first know what islam is and who is imam zaman and there are various true incidents where imam zaman had appeared to help ppl the it's a long topic I don't want to discuss it here just the conclusion here is the all story is of fake and falsehood plz dont take it serious it's completely spreading falsehood.... thanks There's a scene in the movie in which an Islamic figure, by the name of Imam Zaman, was humiliated and the feelings of Shia Muslims were hurt in the guise of cheap comedy. Learn to narrate stories without crossing boundaries and know how to practice basic manners and show respect towards fellow humans, regardless of their faith. Highly disappointed! I just say that remove the whole part of Imam Mehdi because this is very irrelevant and The name of the movie is: ‘The Persian Version' which has many problems and insults. It mocks the belief in Imam Mehdi (a) and claims he comes to help in animal form as well other unacceptable descriptions. Absolute trash - don't waste your time. Completely disrespectful of Shia beliefs and so uncultured. If I could give a minus star I would Absolute waste of time. The bad acting, the forced plot of an immigrant family's life & then continue to NOT depict the culture & lives of immigrant. The movie specifically targets the muslim beliefs and if there was a negative rating possible I give it negative rating. I'm distasteful and misleading depiction of religious beliefs, star of the show needs paycheck and will read any script passed to her. Terrible movie; don't waste your time on it This movie show wrong information. Horrible. Misrepresentation of Shia Muslims. Mockery of religious beliefs by spread of false information. Attempt to disrespect beliefs of Shia Muslims by misguiding audience regarding their beliefs. Very inconsiderate and factually incorrect in addressing the religious beliefs of a particular sect. This movie which aimed to show the Iranian beliefs and lifestyle is totally not what it meant to be. The houses and traditions were not at all Iranian and more like Indian. And not only this, the WORST of all was how the filmmakers and the writers as well as the actors decided to stoop as low as they can by deciding that it was somehow okay to be disrespectful to the Muslim beliefs!! By saying that Imam e Zamana (AJTF) appears out of no where in a suspicious way and could come in the form of an animal (Nauzubillah) was absolutely vile! Calling the beliefs of Shia Muslims magic and whatnot. How is it okay to be disrespectful to the religious beliefs of a community while unsuccessfully trying to depict their culture? I felt absolutely disgusted and triggered by seeing that my beliefs are now going to be presented by someone who's not even close to knowing the reality, in such a twisted way. If it was possible, I would've given a negative rating to this excuse of a movie. This topic is extremely sensitive on the muslims belief and it also insults Islamic religion..grow up why gotta make such false imformated movies about religion..and how about you make a movie about the ongoing genocide i think it's much better to talk about the the truth that's going on today than informing fake information about a religion...this is the shittiest movie i've ever watched.."
Drama,challengers_2024,"Challengers is, undoubtedly, the greatest tennis movie yet made. It’s likely to frustrate a lot of viewers with its seeming lack of closure. And I’m going to stubbornly claim that the film’s furious conclusion is, in fact, perfect closure if you’re tracking what the movie is really about, what it values most. The way the story is framed makes it hard to penetrate. It’s riveting at moments and maddening at others, unsure of exactly what it wants to be and, most importantly, who’s actually meant to be its protagonist. Challengers is a unique vision from a talented filmmaker. It’s far from his most daring work, but its over-the-top self-indulgence makes for a surprisingly entertaining watch. Maybe it’s because a tennis ball doesn’t offer the same level of softness or moisture as a peach, but the attempts to make Challengers as sexy and sensual as Call Me By Your Name don’t quite come off. What does come off is pretty much everything else. It’s as if the movie is playing its own tennis match. It’s cruising along, and looks to be on its way to victory. But then along come some unforced errors ... and the tide turns. Game, set, match. Better luck next time. Still ... Zendaya is pretty great.
 'Challengers' moves with an impressive amount of skill. Its pacing, and especially its innovative cutting, jumping back and forth through time, make things seem constantly exciting.  Challengers isn't so much a sports drama with romance in as much as it is a work of art. This movie is shrewd about male insecurity, including how men can bond over screwing one another over. Challengers simply makes you feel alive. Kurtizkes understands the inherent animalistic drive behind desire, whether it be for love or ambition.There may not be a more successful attempt on screen in recent times to illustrate how there is and never will be a greater aphrodisiac than competition Challengers might not be the tennis movie you expect, but it’s the tennis movie Guadagnino wanted us to see and we are totally here for that. Tense, sharp and extremely sexy, it tastes just as delicious as it looks. What really elevated the film was its bone-rattling score, mesmerizing cinematography, and the undeniable chemistry of its leads. Whether it's that he's by far the best actor of the trio or Kuritzkes was just able to write one of his characters light-years better than the others, O'Connor's transformation into a trickster spoiler provides the suspense and allure necessary to invest. Tennis is just a metaphor for sex, with each serve, volley, and grunt representing the push-pull of the movie’s central threesome. Love is a losing proposition in tennis, but in “Challengers,” it’s everything.  Luca Guadagnino brings all of his tricks and executes a film that is both entertaining & sexy. Challengers wears its bruises, but the pain is worth the winning result. It is one of the year’s sexiest and most exciting films, and a new commercial high point for one of cinema’s most sensuous auteurs. It’s not quite as assured or mature in its depiction of game-playing as a life’s work, but its frothy charms are as compelling as they are exasperating. Exciting, knotty, over-determined, desperate and high on its own supply. Just like its characters. Nobody does fleshy uncertainty like Luca Guadagnino. And he’s found a great, razor-sharp script that lends itself to his gifts for vibrancy and internalized drama, as well as longtime cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom’s artistry with light.  Everything in this movie is firing on all cylinders. Amazing performances, incredible soundtrack, impeccably shot. Pure cinema.","I was excited to see this, most of the marketing had lead me to believe Zendaya was the star role, though she took a very back seat role to the two guys and neither of them are as good as she is. Her moments on screen just made that all the more apparent. The time jumps weren’t totally confusing, but they were jolting and I’m not sure it worked that well, or rather that it was totally necessary. More than half way through the movie and the scene was still being set with back story. It felt like the whole premise wasn’t that deep anyway, so the constant scene setting ended up feeling like they were beating a dead horse. The music, sound creation and editing/sequencing weren’t anything special either. All in all a not bad but not good film, probably less enjoyable if you don’t care about tennis, which I do. It felt like the main reason for the film was to focus on bisexuality tbh more than tennis or plot. I wasted a free trial of MGM+ on this movie. Zendaya can’t seem to act unless scowling in her films. Really disliked this movie. Awkward and uncomfortable to watch. I didn’t feel any chemistry between any of them. Lacked plot, character development, story line. I went in thinking I’d love this movie. But it fell flat for me. I did like it, but it was more of a one and done. I legit thought I’d see it again but now I don’t think I will. The plot was very intriguing and Zendaya was obviously the stand out. The music was also bumping. My issue was some of the creative choices made distracted from the plot and certain things became confusing due to it. Also they could have shortened the movie a bit to make under 2 hours. I think if they had reworked this movie it could have been a home run (or the tennis equivalent for that). I can see what Guadagnino was trying to do. Very ambitious but it fell short for me. He was trying too hard to get moments to happen but they didn't land. Definitely not worth the hype. Liked the tennis aspect of the movie. Started strong left me confused. It was as if they tried to make a boring story deep and thought putting Zendaya in it would bring it home for them. Big miss. Noch nie hat man eine so billige Story auf so hohem Niveau gesehen. Great film! Zendaya is a kickass actress! Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist did a stellar job as wel. Luca Guadagnino crafted this film very well! It had some shots, especially during Tennis games. I think this film is a bit longer than it needs to be. it was amazing to watch in the cinema 2 hours and 11 minutes of my life I won't get back. Over long and sooo boring. Cheesy, unintelligent movie designed to show off Zendaya. I really enjoy high-quality sports movies, but this film uses tennis as a metaphor for a love triangle involving three abnormal individuals in a very accurate way.

Let me just say why this film is good. Firstly, it's technically very good. I'll detail the scene I'll say is the best, but overall, the use of cameras, where they stand, and the masterpiece climax in the final scene, make the direction top-notch.

The casting fits the script perfectly. Sometimes, it's the actors who determine the tension of a film, and in this film, our trio of leads creates a fantastic tension, very successfully.

Thirdly, the use of sports as a tool. In normal sports films, the main focus is on the sport and the plane it creates, but Challengers goes beyond that and metaphorizes tennis very successfully. And tennis could truly be the most individual among individual sports, so it's a very apt choice. The metaphor of the tennis ball being Tashi, especially, enchanted me. The back and forth between Art and Pat, and finally Art winning because of the Grandslam, is not an easy metaphor.

Fourthly, and the part I loved, the climax scene is amazing. Taking such a risk in shooting in such a different technique and jolting the audience in the theater with that scene is really well done. Putting the camera in place of the ball, drawing a bomb on the camera, shooting from different angles, all accompanied by a simple music that tells the tempo very well, is really the right move.

Fifthly, the film's sexiness is very well placed. The love scenes are not exaggerated and really well placed. Maybe the red-lighted scene at the end is a bit swagger, but all the characters look very sexy. Congratulations to Zendaya, Mike Faist, and John O'Conner, good job.

The point I didn't like is that the simple concept of family wasn't filled out enough, in my opinion. When Art and Tashi's child is mentioned, there should have been a flashback to that period and the importance of that in their lives should have been explained. Yes, the film is super-paced and great, but I feel it lacks something, and with a 5-6 minute scene added, the film could have been a 10/10 for me. Also, the focus on Pat's wound. Since we focused on it, we could have had 1 or 2 scenes of Pat's suffering as well.

And finally, I want to address people's comments. I think the ratings are exactly what the film deserves, the positives are very dominant, but there are minimal shortcomings, so the ratings are just right. Some people have said (especially in my country), ""oh, we were very uncomfortable, it's exaggerated,"" etc. Dude, the whole point of the film is to try to explain a sick situation; all three characters have big personal problems; one worships people, the other worships sports (and of course, meaningless ambition and success), and the other behaves loosely and cowardly. Sorry, but it's silly to accept this situation as normal and make comments; excuse my bluntness, but watch the movie and try to understand it.

The film is very enjoyable and flows excessively, not a second boring, watch it in the cinema.

Additionally, some of the argument scenes in the film and the overall structure also resemble a tennis match, I forgot to explain (metaphor) that in my review, but I think this is also a major factor in the film's success. (For example, the argument scene between Tashi and Patrick in their rooms fits perfectly. This fight just like a tennis match.) Just because you can see where it is going does not mean you dont want to see it go there. Tense, steamy, messy. And they managed to end it well. Great watch! Bold, gripping, and delivers strong performances! This must be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Zendaya's vanity project as an excuse to star in her own soft-porn fantasy is a deadly dull waste of acting talent.
And the tennis scenes are even more ridiculous than the premise.
Unwatchable drivel. Terrible movie. I feel I just wasted 2 hours of my time. Make yourself a favor and skip it I was told this was a try-not-to-cream challenge. I did not cream. Very disappointed. The movie had interesting highlights where tennis is a way to bring friends together, yet can also destroy the relationship if not being utilized properly. Zendaya's presence does show a strong essence in how two guys would challenge each other to get the same thing. The combination of music and the usage of style in presentation brought livelihood through life in youth. It is relatively fresh and appreciate the contrast it brings in comparison to Battle of the Sexes. One of the worst movies of the year...boring like hell, the story is also supersad and cold. Hated it and wasted what seemed to be 8 hours of my life"
