Horror,thanksgiving_2023,"Thanksgiving feels like a wasted opportunity. We are still waiting for that project that will make Roth a household name. Eli Roth gives the holiday the bloody horror comedy it deserves. This throwback to 90s horror slasher is [Roth’s] best work. I can absolutely see this film becoming a new holiday classic, solely on its opening scene... There’s enough nasty comedy in Roth’s crazed kills to make Thanksgiving worth a watch. Leftovers may be scarce, but you’ll definitely be returning to this one year after year. The use of this particular holiday as a horror motif is interesting, but without the period aesthetic that made that teaser so successful, it's just teens getting murdered again. Thanksgiving most of what people want from the slasher subgenre. It has some wit, it has twists, it has novelty, and it’s genuinely well-made. It all concludes in a denouement that implies that Roth isn't done with the holiday forever—and, hey, if a sequel comes along, I'd be down for seconds. The latest gorefest from Eli Roth (“Hostel”) is a typical slasher flick with the gimmick of being set in Plymouth, Mass., over two Thanksgivings. ... It’s not a turkey, but it’s also not as clever as Roth wants it to be. This is a colourful, gruesome horror comic which pokes fun at/holes in an array of culpable characters. What’s not to love?  Eli Roth's 'Thanksgiving' is macabre, bloody and unexpectedly funny. The director takes slasher brutality to a new level to tell a story that is already iconic among horror fans.

 The real villain in this is American consumerism.  Nonetheless, in the times of horror films with elaborate twists, a return to a conventional narrative structure is gratifying. [Full review in Spanish] With stronger plotting and characters worth rooting for, this raucously amusing but forgettable genre carve-up might have stirred more gratitude. I appreciate good practical effects, and that's what we get in this movie. Gory and often unpleasant, Thanksgiving follows the rules of the slasher genre and not much else. [Full review in Spanish] Roth mustered all his energy into this effort. Armed with everything he learned over his career, Roth’s positioned to make the next great holiday horror classic. The structure and killer reveal are a little wonky, and at times it feels like Roth and Jeff Rendell are trying to shoe horn in elements from the faux trailer, but the kills are solid and the vibe is very fun A gory good time that doesn't aspire to be anything more than a fun slasher, a goal that it wholeheartedly achieves.","Se podría decir que es algo típico de Eli Roth, pero esta vez demasiado bueno, con tanta sangre y esos efectos espectaculares al momento de los asesinatos y destruir cabezas. Es lo mejor que eh visto en tanto a muertes grotescas e historia buena. If you like very bloody gory horror movies, then this is your movie. Personally not my forte but I still enjoyed the premise and storyline (but I definitely had to look away during some of the scenes). But if you’re into that kinda stuff, then you’ll probably really like it. It has you on your toes from the start.  Delivers a scream or two based on your horror fan-ness.  There is a surprise. Shocking! Great New Movie! The most interesting thing is iphone, apple computer, YouTube, and Instagram. Also would like to add they got him with a iphone. Horror/Mystery horror, mystery, thriller, so it was a mystery horror movie but it was a horror movie about Thanksgiving. Best gore movie ever! Entertaining gore with some over the top kills. The twist was telegraphed a bit much but overall a good time. This is the most, I repeat the most pathetic movie you will ever watch in 2024. Uma temática batida, mas com uma motivação/crítica muito interessante e moderna.
A criatividade também pode ser destacada em diversos ""atos"".
Para o que se vê ultimamente dentro deste gênero, esse aqui possui um enorme destaque.

Recomendo aos apreciadores. Genuinely horrible, no persistent storyline and far fetched even in terms of movie physics. one of the worst horror movies i've ever seen
corny script and bad acting best horror movie of 2023 Bad script, poor acting, very cheesy and unbelievable. This is only for a “certain” audience. Utterly disappointing, especially for horror lovers. The film fails to deliver the suspense and thrills that genre enthusiasts crave, leaving them feeling let down and unfulfilled. Nothing truly negative about Thanksgiving, but not truly exceptional about it either. It works better as a whodunnit movie with very specific slasher elements than as a slasher horror film itself. Never scary, but it overcomes the lack of shivers with some campy death scenes and an effort to make a social comment on consumerism - but it approaches those elements in such a careless and unfocused way that the message feels ineffective for most audiences. Nell Verlaque lacks the screen-magnetism in order to land this movie to a safe place in terms of quality - and we all know the importance of having an engaging lead in this genre - but Patrick Dempsey (a supporting actor here) has that ""on-screen X factor"" and he ignites the screen during his scenes! Still... it's not enough! It has features some really good scenes, like the making of the ""turkey"" or the trampoline murder scene (which combines an horrific to watch killing with an extremely erotic subcontext). Unfocused cinematography work, average sound work and a bland ensemble cast of teens can't elevate this film above the director's vision (or maybe they fail because of the directing). So, Thanksgiving is inconsistent and that's why it doesn't reach a positive ground for me, but it's watchable... but not worth the admission's price. Her scenes are very graphic and she knows how to keep the attention of those who see her. One of the best slashers out there. Thanksgiving greets us with gory kills and a perfect mix of comedy. I have no clue what the rest of you were smoking when you watched this and then gave it 5 stars but I couldn't even make it through the first scene at Walmart. Hardest watch to date, was too cringey and awful to even consider continuing. Probably has some alright social commentary (considering the part I *did* stick around for) but it's so ridiculous that it completely takes you out of the experience. 

I'm disappointed that they didn't take it down the path of an OBVIOUS Thanksgiving revenge movie - that would've meant a whole lot more. Great to watch to past time but not the best story Great concept with awesone kills and special fx. John Carver is now an icon for the Thanksgiving season. Básicamente la historia es mala, malísima, y no se la puede tomar en serio en ningún momento. Usa demasiados clichés que ya se hicieron una y otra vez en el cine slasher, y obviamente mas de una vez mejor que en esta cinta. Se aleja demasiado del fake trailer que vimos en Grindhouse. Pero así y todo termina siendo un gran espectáculo y digna de ser vista al menos una vez. Se nota que Eli Roth sabia muy bien la ridiculez de trama que estaba contando así que lo usa a su favor, llevando todo a un nivel de bizarres extremo que incluso tiene tiempo de mostrar buenos momentos de humor (varias veces oscuro pero humor al fin). Las escenas de gore se ven buenísimas, una mezcla entre cgi y efectos prácticos que no se ven todos los días. Las actuaciones son un punto aparte de destacar para bien, se nota que querían que sean exageradas pero extrañamente logran quedar bien. A pesar de desbarrancar varias veces te mantiene interesado mientras avanza. En fin, sabiendo como es este fandom se va a convertir en un clásico de culto para varios y sabiendo como es esta industria seguro va a tener alguna que otra secuela porque tiene tela para hacerlo, de hacerlas ojala logren por lo menos equiparar la calidad de esta."
Horror,dream_scenario,"Borgli examines what happens to one’s self-image when thrust into the spotlight so suddenly, and when that goes wrong, what lasting harm is left? Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage) has a pretty great, if not uneventful life, but he yearns for more. His wants aren't completely out of bounds, he wants recognition, respect and the adoration of his family. Who could ask for anything more? Dream Scenario manages to create expectations during its first act, but the promises of something wild or interesting always remain at a distance; we can feel the potential, but the film never goes there Thankfully Borgli never allows his commentary on social media, masculinity, and modern celebrity to obscure the fact that our dreams can always potentially contain the sort of magic that can't always be a part of our waking life. Nicolas Cage delivers one of his best films, a study on fame, networks, and dreams. [Full review in Spanish] When the credits begin, the feeling of having had one of those great dreams interrupted, and that can never be resumed, arises. [Full review in Spanish] Given the challenge of playing someone who isn’t interesting, Cage does something interesting with every single scene. ... He’s as surprisingly funny in Dream Scenario as he was surprisingly dramatic and endearing in 2021’s Pig. While there’s a strong hint of classic Kaufman to the surrealism, there’s nothing cliche or predictable in Dream Scenario. Borgli excels at creating an atmosphere that makes the viewer question whether the scene is happening or a dream. Each dream is like a short and would make a riveting film. It is like having a horror movie short film festival in one movie. It tells us a lot about the ephemerality of fame in the modern world, social media, advertising agencies and, somewhat randomly, technology. Nic Cage is sublime and I can't complain about the supporting performances either. Full review in Spanish, More like a dream that you only kinda enjoy, don’t really remember, and feel little need to share with someone else. There’s a lot going on in the performance, and it can be riveting on a number of levels. But I was left with the nagging feeling that Dream Scenario could’ve and should’ve been more than it is, with a conclusion that matches Cage’s complexity and gusto. Neither a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare, Borgli's far-reaching satire on cancel culture and metatextual reception theory overstays its welcome but finds Nicolas Cage in fantastic form as a victim of his own Jungian conundrum. This is a daring project not because of its crazy premise, but because of the almost perfect dissection it makes of a society obsessed with the fame of unknown people... [Full review in Spanish] A psychological fantasy satire that hits a nerve with just how real this surreal trip of a movie is.

 This movie is incredibly inventive. Nicolas Cage is fantastic in this role as a man who can't quite deal with all the things that are happening to him that he has no control over.  Dream Scenario turns its approach into an excuse for a light chapter of 'Black Mirror'. Luckily for everyone, nothing that Talking Heads' music can't fix. [Full review in Spanish] Kristoffer Borgli manages to compose a comedy with the soul of a horror film. [Full review in Spanish] A dystopian fable about cancel culture that borders the line between humor and terror. [Full review in Spanish] It is original and destabilizing, moving from the surreal and the sinister to comedy with total naturalness. [Full review in Spanish]","Dream Scenario is the kind of film that makes you wonder if Nicolas Cage was born to redefine 'over-the-top' or if 'over-the-top' was invented to keep up with Nicolas Cage. It's a masterclass in eccentricity, featuring Cage in a performance so quintessentially Nic Cage that it feels like he's playing every Nic Cage meme ever made. He navigates the bizarre plot with an intensity that suggests he’s not just acting but channelling an ancient, mystical Nic Cage energy from a dimension where subtlety is a banned substance. The movie is a fever dream of outlandish scenarios and Cage’s signature quirks, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the actor's unique brand of what can only be described as ""enthusiastic lunacy."" How is this possibly at a 91%? It was ambitious and occasionally visually compelling, but the whole story and writing was atrocious.  I kept waiting for it to get good and it just didn’t.  Nothing but boomer humor It starts off as an interesting premise but quickly becomes a hamfisted and lame attempt at a cancel culture allegory There are some details that make this feel real, but it's so bizarre your milage will vary probably based on your fondness for Nicolas Cage. It not a terrible supporting cast either, but this premise kinda runs thin. Nic Cage is showing up in people's dreams. I would have been curious why, but that mystery isn't brought up. There's a tangent in the third act that took this down a major step. The movie should make you think about fame and why the quest for it isn't what it's cracked up to be. I suspect that premise could be lost in Cage's performance. Final Score: 6.5/10 Dream Scenario is one of the best comic performance by Nicholas Cage is like what if Freddy Kruger having a his origin story going inside people and teens dreams and killing them and the script is really razor sharp brilliantly idea of balancing of dark comedy and fantasy in A24 film. A truely original, interesting movie, I was grabbed by it and it kept me intrigued! I really recommend Loved Nicolas Cage in this. Just felt it could have been a good movie with a different end. The premise is great, specially for a darker movie, which this isn't, sadly. Right away, that is one of the problems, the movie does not know what it is, it is listed as ""Comedy, Drama, Mystery, Thriller, Horror"". Just pick one or two, mate, not the whole catalog.
The first half of the movie is an easy 9/10, there is suspense and drama with a sprinkle of horror, the problem is that they did not really know what to do after that and took some weird turns leading to a really bad ending. Honestly, they should've leaned into the nightmares and terror, the maddening of the main character, the building rage and evil, the consequences, the suspense, etc., instead they just go ""the dream and  nightmares just stopped and no one knows why, and here is a dream product and a teen dream house of influencers"" like WTF!? Out of nowhere the movie takes a sharp turn and abandons the whole mystery, the dreams, the nightmares, the maddening, the rage, etc.
Movie goes from 9/10 to 2/10 in the blink of an eye, really sad to see that. Overall, a 4.5/10 just because the first half of the movie is so great and Cage's acting is on point. Amazing acting and the script is perfect! An interesting and unique tale that proves if your storytelling craft is strong, you don't need a big budget and over the top CGI to make a quality movie. Cage excels here, making boring interesting. A career highlight for him This might have to be one of the best movies I have ever seen I mean Nicholas Cage was amazing in his roll he played him perfectly and just the impact it had and how it made me feel is just WOW if you like sociological dramas and movies that make u question this is is a MUST SEE it is just amazing Dream Scenario is a great movie and a nice commentary on fame and the side effects that come with it and how people will try to profit on anything new and the problems that come with it. I would certainly recommend if you want to watch a weird movie that will leave you with questions after watching. Says it’s a comedy. If it is, it’s for a total of 10 minutes combined, if that much. Two thirds in goes downhill and finishes leaving the spectators wondering only one thing, “why’d they lose their time watching this”. This movie is the type of movie that for some people, might require multiple viewings to truly understand all the concepts.
Problem is, although it's very different - which i apppreciate very much, in today's world of copy paste movies -, i don't think most people would be able to re-watch it.

Personally, i enjoyed the first half very much; it got me intrigued and hooked. But after all the weirdness that happens throughout the movie, i would have liked a more concise and definitive ending, instead of a more ambiguous and ""artsy"" one. 

At the end, i still enjoyed it but was left wanting more.

Nicholas Cage gives a great performance. One of his best ones. There were some quiet and emotional moments where he was giving it his all.

I think this is a good watch, ig you have company to you can discuss the movie's concepts and what is it about. This film will get under your skin and into your thoughts. Everything is going great until it suddenly isn’t. The power of the mind can be a frightening thing. Cage gives an exquisite performance in this provocative piece. I felt bad for him most of the movie, and there was always this tension of ‘what kind of bad situation will this get him into next’. Kristoffer Borgli dreams up an unsettling apologue about a lecturer inexplicably appearing in dreams of millions to mull over abrupt notoriety, cancel culture and proceeds to make our heads swim with weightier issues of mediocrity of existentialism and needfulness for approval. Good acting but just depressing with no happy ending or any real explanation of what happened at all. Terrible! Movie starts slow and lacks any real substance. I understand the movie concept is interesting but this film is underwhelming and not entertaining. I watched about an hour before turning off. Yo la primera mitad de la película: Ay que bonito, Nicolas Cage está recibiendo la atención de todos.
Yo la segunda mitad de la película: Mendigo coraje tengo atorado, mátalos a todos de una vez."
Horror,five_nights_at_freddys,"There are no scares — but even worse — there’s no fun. Five Nights at Freddy’s is as predictable as it is disappointing.

 I don't know if my brain will maintain its cranial structural integrity... Everything has a purpose and the designs are enough that OG fans will understand everything but new fans will also pick up on the clues that are being dropped through the design. Five Nights at Freddy’s had everything working in its favor. The film’s cast has a solid cinematic genealogy. Jim Henson Creature Shop assisted with animatronics. FNAF fandom waited in anticipation for years, continuing to world-build and create lore. A frontrunner for the top ""Oh right, that is a real movie I saw"" movie of the year but there's enough here to be likable enough for me in the moment.  The adaptation of the 'Five Nights at Freddy's' video game saga is a failed attempt to bring the mock horror of the original to film [Full Review in Spanish]
 Tammi does a great job bringing the 'Five Nights at Freddy's' video game to the big screen. Five Nights At Freddy’s could have done more to capture the simple terror of its video game inspiration’s storytelling. However, director Emma Tammi has delivered a crowd-pleasing retro horror that has the potential to be just as much of a cult favourite. Fight Nights at Freddy’s is just not effective enough as horror and has a slowly plodding pace that can’t be saved by its talent. The ending sort of sets up a sequel but if we are to spend any more nights at Freddy’s lets hope the creative team bring more fear and dread to make these animatronic antagonists less cuddly. A tame yet enjoyable triumph for fans of the video game. Those unfamiliar with the series might walk away feeling more lost than a devoted fan. You’d be forgiven for expecting a zany, over-the-top romp in which heroes battle the increasingly creepy cartoon animal-like robots as they fight to stay alive, but it isn’t that. Well, OK, it’s … kinda that … eventually. All this movie needs is Nic Cage and it'd be fine.  A deeply unpleasant and quite ridiculous game of hopscotch among devastating kidnapping thriller, nasty family drama, and empty serial killer nonsense. The film mostly concentrates on Mike’s familial travails and history. It flails around trying to come up with psychologically resonant characteristics for its protagonist. It ends up with an inert and implausible narrative.  Intended (apparently) as a horror flick, it’s not scary, and, despite the absurdity of the story, it’s not funny. It’s barely anything at all. A lot of it feels like an Elm Street sequel, and you’ve got to respect a film about menacing animatronics that casts Mary Stuart Masterson. An early sequence where we watch these mascots come to life and dispatch a group of people shows promise for something better (and the animatronics do look pretty solid), but it’s all for naught. This is about as good as cardboard pizza. A video game adaptation made overtly for the fans and only the fans.  Newcomers will be totally lost, but it's target audience should have fun. So much plot is crammed into this nearly 2-hour film that it's honestly quite shocking that there's nary a scare to be found.","When I watch this movie I love it This is 100% worth the watch. Lots of call backs to the games and lots of amazing performances from the actors. All the practical effects where amazing and truly worth your time and energy The best film for the fan base that has been waiting the most for their entire lives.
It may have disappointed the critics, and left loose ends, but it managed to satisfy many of the other expectations that (many, including me) were afraid they wouldn't please. As a piece of artwork, this movie doesn't offer too much. However, for creepypastas lovers, this movie can be interesting. erm arrr arrr arr. seriously cool enough but not that scary :/ La peli es buena los, bots están hermosos. Pero está llena de cosas que ni tienen sentido y cosas que ni se explican no tiene varios momentos buenos que te hagan verla. Y eso que me gusta esta saga. En resumen no aprovecharon bien la historia y los personajes. Es buena, pero está muy muy mal hecha a más no poder. Y como peli de terror es... There a horror movie but without the horor Amazing movie as a fnaf fan,parents wasn't really fond of the movie but definitely one of my favourite to this day I watched Five Nights Of Freddy’s and I enjoyed it. The best way I can describe it is “Night Of The Museum meets Chuck E. Cheese, but with a scary tone.” It had a good humor and tone. It was a little light on the horror (which I expected since it was PG-13) but it still had its moments. We're waiting every night to finally roam and invite

Five Nights at Freddy's, oh. - The Living Tombstone Everyone dies except Freddy Great Horror Movie, And Fabulous Scenery for it's budget. Allthough somethings aren't connected to the games. So excited for the next movie, It's a Fantastic experience 👍 It not Lore related which it would be better if it was lore related but it was still good Me encanta 
La película es una adaptación perfecta del juego
Pero es verdad que lo único que falta es el terror y si resulta algo aburrida ya que esta sentada en los humanos 😔 
Pero para mí es buena😄 Faithful to the games and would please longtime fans of the franchise though could be better if it was rated R I enjoy the movie very much I honestly thought that it might never come out This movie is a hit for me. As a person who loves fanf I see this movie as a great movie that has elements of the five nights at Freddy’s lore. It was ok a best not scary at all Five Nights at Freddy's Is a must See If you're a FNaF Fan. They nailed the Movie and the animatronics. But If you dont know FNaF or arent a big Fan, you wont really Like the Movie. It was Made for the Fans. While the main story drags on sometines, it certainly captures the feel of FNAF with great actors, mystery and a dash of humor!"
Horror,peeping_tom_1960,"There have been many movies suggesting that filmgoers are by nature voyeurs -- Hitchcock himself made a masterpiece in this vein with Rear Window -- but few have been as damning as Peeping Tom. Michael Powell’s elegant and disturbing Peeping Tom turns its camera eye on an unhealthy obsession with all things cinematic. A movie like no other ... Powell has no interest in assuaging the audience’s feelings or letting them know it’s all right and everything will be fine. Set in contemporary London, which Powell evokes in a lush, colorful seediness, this film presents Mark as much victim as villain and implicates the audience in his scopophilic activities ... Here voyeurism itself looks outwards and inwards, confounding perpetrator and victim, filmmaker and viewer, camera and phallic weapon, while observing a pathology as metacinematic as it is psychiatric. It’s a horror classic of the highest order, a piece of master filmmaking by an iconic artist at the top of his game. The film remains dangerous and brilliant... A feverish cult object among horror acolytes and classic film buffs alike.  [Michael Powell] did not write Peeping Tom; but he cannot wash his hands of responsibility for this essentially vicious film.  A masterclass in filmmaking that puts a sociopath in a sympathetic light. Uncomfortable but compelling, Peeping Tom is not to be missed.  This proto-slasher film is making fascinating observations about class, nationality and gender, but it's so well integrated it never feels heavy handed. Powell's meta shooting style is inspired and Vivian Shearer makes a big impression in only 2 scenes. Mark who is the peeping tom in this situation is probably up there with one of the most complex characters in cinema. Directed by Michael Powell with British Anarchy ... crazy but exquisitely reserved. Recognized now as one of his greatest films, a primer for the use of the camera as an eye and point of view. We are all voyeurs when we watch a movie Almost all who act as voyeurs in their love of cinema will never hurt another person- not fatally, anyway. That doesn't mean we aren't irreparably altered by our voyeurism. A timeless and sublime masterpiece that presents an incredibly intelligent and moving picture of psychological struggle. An integral film for the development of the horror genre. Peeping Tom didn't make me want to streak out of the cinema shrieking, as Franju's film did at times; it gives me the creeps in retrospect, in my heart and mind more than in my eyes. Carl Boehm must be credited with a portrayal whose discretion has probably saved the film from its own worst excesses of morbidity. So many movies about the most depraved of life-takers also function as therapies for their audiences; this one makes us accessories to deplorable deeds, and rejects all opportunities to find relief from them. It is now justly recognized as a classic of its disturbing kind, treating its material with a restraint, seriousness, and compassion that many of today's filmmakers could learn from.","One of the best cinematic horror of the 60's it is the British version of Psycho and Peeping Tom is a masterpiece of slasher and the cinematography looks unique beautiful shot and quite disturbing and uncomfortable for viewers and Michael Powell did really fantastic director but sadly the critics gone to far for not allowing Powell to make more films. One of a greatest movie in the history of cinema. It's truly incredible to look back and consider which films were vilified upon release. One thing they invariably have in common is that they look incredibly tame by today's standards, even laughably so, and that's exactly where Peeping Tom comes in. Released just a few months earlier than Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, which would redefine the horror genre and help created the slasher subgenre, its critical mauling effectively destroyed director Michael Powell's career, something you can do nowadays with a single ill-advised tweet. And it's such a shame, because Peeping Tom isn't just a pale imitation of Psycho, it's a fantastic horror film in its own right. Much like the Hitchcock classic, it's a psychological study of a disturbed young man with a bizarre relationship with his family, and it heavily utilises the theme of voyeurism to both tell its story and put the audience into the mind of the lead. To see the crimes through the mind of a killer is to be complicit in them, and it might have been this realisation that so disgusted audiences in 1960, or maybe it was because the decade hadn't got swinging yet and everyone was still so uptight. It's far less bloody than most horror films released every year, focusing more on the mentality of the killer rather than the kills themselves. The music doesn't work as well as Bernard Hermann's legendary score from Psycho, but in many ways the film is just as good, if not very close. A compelling lead, disturbing themes, kills that are more frightening than bloody and a tension and creepiness that pervades every scene make Peeping Tom a truly underrated classic, and a film that deserves the reputation it's earned in later years, and never warranted such a violent backlash in the first place. Irredeemably awful and, for what is supposed to be a legendary cinematic groundbreaker, is more boring than sitting in the dentist's waiting room and as entertaining as cleaning the cat litter box.

Powell: yes, the legend who brought us ""The Thief of Baghdad"" and ""The Red Shoes"" (which, as a former ballet dancer and later a balletmaster, remains a personal favourite).  But … a decade or two later and the trademarks have not matured: retina-burning oversaturated colours, over-staged blocking (he's what'cha call an auteur, ain't he?), and mindboggling, dreadful acting down the line (OK – I liked the brief dance/murder sequence with Moira Shearer, but the choreography looked like something Mary Tyler Moore did on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" in the same era).

Karlheinz Böhm (whose main attribute is that he is a son of Karl Böhm, one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century and a Nazi collaborator; he did his post-war time and went on to conduct until he could barely lift the baton) seems to be aping Peter Lorre and has all the charisma of a public lavatory floor.

And he is just one among a sea of zombies.

I am extremely disappointed: I was led on for decades about what a masterpiece it was, and now that I finally catch up with it (thank you, Criterion; can I please get my money back?), I am hugely disappointed on every possible level.

To suggest this was ""groundbreaking"" and ""ahead of its time"" is pure heresy.  Kindly have a look at what a true auteur was doing around 1960: watch some Goddard (up to 1967) and Truffaut and anybody from the nouvelle vague, some Visconti and Bertolucci, some Fellini, some Kurosawa and Teshigahara, some Buñuel, some Kubrick, some … OK.  You get the idea. There's much to admire, technically at least, if not in other aspects too, in Michael Powell's film, which many consider as the first slasher film. The location shots are like visual records of 1960s London while Powell's fluid camerawork is dramatic, informative and creative. Leo Marks' chilling screenplay about Carl Boehm's Mark Lewis, a shy, camera-obsessed young man who murders prostitutes and actresses in order to capture on film their last moments of fear, is also ahead of its time if only in its inclusion of the killer's backstory to make him more human and sympathetic. However, at the same time ironically, it's hard not to find this all a bit dated as well, especially with the modern audience's considerably desensitized palate, both regarding nudity and violence to women. Boehm's acting is on the uneven side, sometimes very convincing but too arch and laboured at other times (though that unintentionally funny and amateurish final scene is entirely Powell's fault); while the jury is still out, at least for me, whether Moira Shearer's dance of death is an ingenious bit of suspense building or just there to remind us she was in The Red Shoes before. However, the casting of real-life nude model/entrepreneur Pamela Green as one of Mark's models and Powell and his son playing Mark's abusive father and young Mark respectively are fascinating decisions that film academics and psychoanalysts will have a field day with. While I'm glad I've seen this, and it is an accomplished film in its own right, I can also understand why, as Hitchcockian as this film is, why the similarly themed Psycho, also released in the same year, did better business and is better remembered in comparison to this steely and creepy arthouse counterpart. Last of the BFI top 100 British films I had to see. I watched it in style in the Prince Charles cinema. Pretty oddball serial killer film. Not really scary, odd moments of lightheartedness. Does a job to entertain but not much more. It came out the same year as Psycho, got overshadowed by Psycho, and I like it a bit more than Psycho. That being said I don't love Psycho as much as most people. 

I was bored for a while and thought parts were kinda silly and feel very dated. By the end though I had grown quite attached to our main couple, even the murdery one. The characters in this movie are so 3 dimensional and sympathetic. Sometimes a movie is made at the wrong time and in the wrong place. In the case of Peeping Tom, the movie was made at the right time but in the wrong place.

In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock directed Psycho, a movie about a voyeuristic serial killer who targeted sexually attractive women due to his inability to let go of deep-seated psychological problems that he had with a parent. The result was an enormously successful movie that greatly enhanced Hitchcock's reputation and helped to open the door for a new decade of cinema where sex and violence became more explicit.

Meanwhile in the same year, Michael Powell made Peeping Tom in Britain, a movie that dealt with the same subjects. But what a difference in response! Guests at the premiere to Peeping Tom shunned Powell. The film received such harsh reviews that it was pulled from the cinema in less than a week. Powell's career in England was ruined, and he was never allowed to make another movie in Britain again. He made a few films in Australia, but none of them acquired the same fame or respect as his earlier ones.

Nowadays Peeping Tom is regarded as one of Powell's greatest films, and an early example of a slasher movie. This last description is misleading, as Powell's film had little influence on later cinema due to its limited availability for many years.

We may well wonder what all the fuss is about. The sex and violence depicted in Peeping Tom seems mild now. In spite of victims being speared in the throat by a blade, we see no blood at all. There is some full frontal nudity for the first time in a mainstream British movie, but very little of that.

So what made Peeping Tom so offensive? One factor is where Powell made the movie. British culture had that curious mixture of sexual inhibition and perversity that Powell portrays in the film, and this repressed attitude meant that Powell's comparatively graphic portrayal of sex and violence was anathema to many. By contrast, there was a comparatively relaxed attitude in America where Hitchcock was working.

The opening scene of this movie sets the tone for what is to come. In a film about scoptophilia (or scopophilia, i.e. voyeurism), the first image that we see is an eye. We are watching someone as he watches a woman. The observer is our ‘hero', Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm). He is wearing a long overcoat that makes you think of a flasher, and in a way that is what he is.

However his overcoat is not designed to reveal, but to conceal. The flashing that he has in mind is the kind that he makes from the camera that he carries with him everywhere, his ‘third arm' as one character calls it. The only exposure that he is interested in is the kind that decides the light and dark of a camera, and he is not interested in revealing himself physically, but in revealing the darker side of others.

The audience are not to be let off the hook in Powell's film. Our voyeuristic love of violence and sex on film is similar to that of Mark, but not taken to the extreme that Mark takes it. Most of us do not take a prurient pleasure in sexual murders, but many of us enjoy watching them when they are on our screens or in the newspaper.

Peeping Tom was one of the first movies to present events from the point of view of the killer. This makes him seem uncomfortably sympathetic and tragic, and the audience are called on to feel a reluctant identification with him. 

The man who provides the voice of Mark's father is Michael Powell himself. The scenes are shot in Powell's own home, and the boy who plays the young Mark is Powell's son. When Helen finally watches one of Mark's murders on film, Powell places the camera in the same position that Mark wished to place it when he asked to film her reactions to his earlier film.

This identifies a problem not just with Mark and his father, but with Powell himself. What is movie if not a violation of its subject matter? Indeed one of Mark's victims is an actress, Vivian (Moira Shearer) who genuinely imagines that she is shooting a private film with him up until the moment that he kills her.

Finally in the movie's last image, the reel stops spinning, and the screen fades to red, as we hear the voice of his father on tape: ""Don't be a silly boy. There's nothing to be afraid of."" If only that were true.

I wrote a longer appreciation of Peeping Tom on my blog page if you would like to read more: https://themoviescreenscene.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/peeping-tom-1960/ ""Peeping Tom"" (1960) is one of the most influential horror films of all time. Director Michael Powell and co-writer Leo Marks have crafted a complex and suspenseful story with a sympathetic yet monstrously wounded protagonist. Mark Lewis is a unique character, as his struggles with his own inner demons are explored in detail. Helen Stephens, the love interest of Mark, adds an extra layer of complexity to the story, as we watch Mark grapple with his feelings for her. The kills in this film are not any less chilling, but they affect us on a deeper level due to Powell's masterful direction. I had no expectations when I began watching ""Peeping Tom"" (1960), yet I was blown away by the end. If you are a horror fan, this one is a must-see. Great filmmaking. Like Hitchcock films, this is a crucial work in this type of thriller, and this has great color and British wit/darkness. Definitely still watchable. Tension retains throughout from the beginning to the end. More potent today than ever, as everyone films everything as a fetish. Downright tasteful compared to the sick bloodbath it would be now. My only quibble is how after Helen’s first visit to his apartment, she doesn’t get the creeps and why would she go back? Even striking up romantic feelings for him? Ok 1960 - that sets the mood for what you do and do not get to see.  It is appropriately creepy and moves right along exposing the mind of a man that is just not quite all there after being subjected to a not so loving Father and his cruel ways of bringing up a son as a guinea pig. Love the visual nature of the film. The vivid colors are great.  I would say - ""Check this one out."" I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this film. It definitely works to scare on multiple levels but I just question its underlying function. Peeping Tom is a prototype for many tropes that would be common in many slashers/serial killer films to follow. The story is somewhat like a car crash in that you almost want to look away but can't. But isn't that somewhat what the content of this film is about? A bit like seeing heavy displays of affection in public, no one wants to stare/watch it but it makes everyone double take. I feel like perversion was almost too prevalent of a theme but I feel in some ways the director was trying to make some sort of Freudian statement on nudity and its effects on people, a statement that was lost on me but probably helped add to the uncanny atmosphere that lingers through the film. If you are a fan of horror/classic horrors this film is an essential viewing. I found this a surprisingly tense and somewhat sinister film. Its not a gory film but the viewer can guess whats going to happen in advance and yet we're kept in the dark in terms of what will be the final act to prompt the violent action (which is mostly hinted at/shown off camera). Its a reasonably early attempt at British horror or claustrophobic thriller I suppose and the fact that the main character, Mark Lewis, is fairly attractive to look at and seemingly a quiet and perhaps somewhat reserved person, is interesting in terms of them not being an obviously dangerous person to look at, although he does appear somewhat menacing when seen staring, as an observer from somewhat distant spaces but I won't say anymore so as not to provide spoilers, other than it does definitely have a claustrophobic feel to it, almost, perhaps, like the films of Hitchcock. 

I suppose the plot is fairly slow, certainly for a modern day horror film - its not quite a regular horror film but it is somewhat unsettling and, as I say, tense. As a slow burning psychological thriller type film, I thought it was reasonably thoughtful and it does well at keeping the viewer guessing and perhaps on the edge of your seat. I imagine when it was released in 1960, it was quite frightening/scary, potentially, to viewers at that time. I'd recommend this film, yes. The greatest Alfred Hitchcock film that Alfred Hitchcock wasn't involved with. Well that was certainly before it's time. Demented , disturbing and complex. Think Hitchcock with a sensible story. Beautiful Powell color. Fascinating to see this early movie influence finsllt, An Obvious impact on Manhunter, a favorite of mine. Even as far reaching as the lousy Sliver and almost good Strange Days. 1960 and it still works. Scoptophelia.  - a new word for me! Small wonder the Brits shunned it back then. Bleak. This is a true classic, powerful piece of film-making with incredible acting by Bohm and expert directing from Powerll, which product sadly cut his career short. The color solutions in this film are just astounding, it's so saturated and at the same time so menacing; the psychological constituent of this movie, developed in the main character, is quite chilling and horrifying and which would serve to be a blueprint for future great and not so great thriller and horror movies. Everyone is a peeping tom in this timeless masterpiece. The movie was disturbing in 1960 and it still is today. The advent of the internet and social media make it even more relevant and thought-provoking. Nearly five decades later, Peeping Tom is still hailed as one of the most crucial films in establishing the horror genre. It's unique, subversive, and truly ahead of its time. Interesting concept, but pretty tame by current standards.  Some compare this to Psycho but there is NO comparison."
Horror,a_creature_was_stirring,"The ending is a bit disappointing/deceiving for those who would be hoping for something different, but the overall effect of the film works and makes it something to check out even outside of the Holiday season.  A Creature Was Stirring feels as though it has something deeper to say, but never seems to find the cohesion and narrative direction to say it. There is a sadness too as the film ends with another holiday seasonal horror missing the mark. There's an ambitious idea buried somewhere in here. Unfortunately, it's covered in the rubble of a cripplingly low budget and over-ambitious screenplay. What could have been a crafty Christmas creature-feature becomes a confusing addiction commentary. Strong performances and impressively unique practical effects earn A Creature Was Stirring a slight recommendation, but an 11th hour reveal threatens to collapse the whole endeavor.  The film has a great cast, direction, set pieces, creature design, and holiday lighting, but first time screenwriter Shannon Wells' ending torpedoes the whole thing. It's worth checking out, but oof. While smartly relying more on its performance and chemistry than creature carnage or gore (although what’s here is suitably grisly), A Creature Was Stirring can’t overcome the limitations that constantly undercut the promise of its title.
 The trajectory of the narrative may be predictable, but the storyline is enjoyably dark. Unfortunately, though, the conclusion is mangled by ridiculously cheap and lazy editing, breaking any discomfort that had been created. A Creature Was Stirring provides enough good things to be worth watching overall. Feel free to laugh at the sheer height of the concept, but be glad that neither the actors nor the director do so. Psychological chills, creature thrills, and family dysfunction become this unfocused commentary on the looming specter of addiction. The unclear nature of the rules and mythology of the horror of A Creature Was Stirring becomes increasingly frustrating as the movie progresses. A Creature Was Stirring is not revenge of a beast story or an attack of a spirit but a human frailty of a secret that literally consumes a mind, a suitcase, and life. “A Creature Was Stirring” has an interesting take on human frailty, but it’s really the stuff of short films, with LaVeck visibly struggling to stretch the story to a longer run time. A Creature Was Stirring does not ignore the more visceral scares. There are some impressive special effects that range from scary to just plain disgusting. The monster is based on something that is terrifying in its own right but rarely seen in horror.","This is an atmospheric & metaphoric movie.   Not scary, nor gory-- but filmed in a surreal setting that feels like a dreamscape.   In that sense I liked it.   

I don't need a perfect story to appreciate the ""feel"" of a movie.   And this delivered a definite vibe. Probably the worst movie Ive seen this year! Wow - this was dreadful. Not in the sense that ""dread"" is part of the viewing experience and an essential ingredient of a well made horror film, but ""dread"" in the sense of being seriously bad.  It was difficult to stay awake at times listening to the mind numbing dialogue and lack of action as it just dragged on and on....and on.  And then when the creature did appear, it had the shock factor of a hairy shadow.   The script was terrible, the plot an incoherent mess full of holes, and the engagement factor nil. How this film ever got a budget is some kind of miracle. Waste of time. this... this movie was phenomenal. a true master peice. the cinematography was beautiful. by FAR the best movie ever made. I recommend this to anyone who has a PASSION for cinema. truly amazing work. this was so beautiful it made me tear up. thank you for this true masterpiece. god bless america. Phenomenal best movie of the year, would recommend a bajillion percent. By far best movie I've ever seen hope they make a second one. Very interesting and immaculate,  I've never felt so strongly about a film in fact I will name my firstborn Charm after the main character. Really moving film hope I never forget the moment in time where I first laid my eyes upon this delectable masterpiece. riddle me this. Why was the dad kinda fine though? Jasper did a great job with the snow effects and being at the party Finally a movie with a great ending! Loved the cast, special effects and thought the ending tied the whole story together. Christmas Horror Movie Struggles to Execute Its Admirable Ideas Had hopes it was going to be a Christmas horror movie, the only thing Christmas about it was the colors with thrown in candy canes. The movie was so bad and made zero sense. The big finale would've made it somewhat worth it had there been implications throughout the movie instead of being super rushed the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. Just watch something else! Would of been better as a short story, this one is very passable. A film that falls flat on its face. Thumbs down"
Horror,a_quiet_place_day_one,"Three movies in, and it’s quite impressive how the Quiet Place series has managed to deliver consistent quality from its seemingly singular hook.  There’s no reason to stay invested in something so uninventive. A Quiet Place: Day One is nothing but a dull apocalyptic routine that doesn’t pay off. The film is another example that well-rounded characters, with earthly problems and goals and with whom it is easy to empathize, are much more important than any contemporary summer blockbuster's special effects.

 While anchored by strong performances from Lupita Nyong’o and Joseph Quinn, Day One brought nothing new to the franchise and relied too heavily on jump scares. First: how many of these damn things are there? Whenever anyone cuts a loud fart (it doesn't happen onscreen, but you know thousands gave their lives for flatulence) there's an alien waiting to smear their blood on a wall. Surpasses expectations for a B/B-minus franchise, going hyper-focused and resisting the urge to go bigger and broader and explain, explain, explain all the whys and wherefores of what's happening. It's the best of the three films, by far.  Lupita Nyong’o’s face is the most effective visual effect in A Quiet Place: Day One. We commit to the story and the world because her eyes tell us so, but beyond her penetrating stare little else in the film feels persuasive enough to commit to. The entertainment value centers around Nyong'o's performance, which is very good. It's an emotional, smart thriller/horror/sci-fi tale that sets the stage for the first two films. The franchise – unlike many that are stretched to the limit – still has value. Putting someone of Nyong’o's caliber in the lead polishes the concept and provides the kind of sheen we haven’t seen since M. Night Shyamalan started directing.
 Michael Sarnoski writes and directs the best film in the franchise so far, something that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who was floored by his debut feature, ""Pig"". [Full Review in Spanish] A Quiet Place Day One centers itself around the human needed for companionship, strength, and a reason to go on. Samira is tired of the pain and she’s looking for one more trip to Harlem to say goodbye and let the teeth fall where they may. An intriguing prequel that complicates the series' nuts-and-bolts horror-thriller premise with a disquieting rumination on mortality and meaning. Plus: a very good cat. There is a real emotional core to this film and a real emotional journey that Lupita Nyong'o goes through as she tries to keep herself, and her cat, alive. This film is absolutely fantastic. It's thrilling, it's terrifying., and keeps you guessing.  Director Michael Sarnoski continues the franchise's winning streak, delivering what might be the best entry yet. A serviceable prequel -- and that's the nicest thing I can say about it... I was invested enough, and it was OK. While the plot races forward, the characters lag, offering as much depth as a slice of New York-style pizza—tasty but ultimately thin. A Quiet Place: Day One, Nyong’o agrees to her own stigmatization -- a perpetual victim archetype in another shabby enterprise. There isn’t wall-to-wall violence. There’s wall-to-wall expectations of it, and that’s even more chilling.  In the film’s sci-fi world, noise is death and quiet is life. Could there be a better metaphor for the dynamics of our digital age?","I thought it was a little boring just because they had to be quiet almost the whole time. But I thought it was kind of interesting and had a couple of scary parts. Really good suspense that grips your attention to the end. A decent, unassuming little film that  would probably have been better had it been released first. As it is, through no particular fault of it's own it just feels a bit redundant. This movie is not terrible, but compared to the first 2 movies this is a huge drop off. The first two had story and you cared about the characters. This one not so much. The first 2 were not perfect I mean they made the same mistakes over and over again. But this was a good bit worse. Miserable movie. Of all the story lines they could have picked to follow for Day 1, they pick this. Doesn’t give any answers to anything and doesn’t contribute to the other movies. Hard pass for anyone who hasn’t seen. Much better movies to spend your time on. Absolut must see! While the movie doesn't rely on world-building, from start to finish it was AMAZING! The two leads were amazing and the story relied more on grounded human emotion rather then straight-up creature carnage.. and i loved it! Even the parts in the city were the action shines were gnarly and violent and show what these monster do in a span of a day... its the most amazing film I've seen yet! It was kind of boring. They should have added more context. Like how did those people find out that the aliens react to sound? And what happened to the kids from the fountain? Why did the military not try bringing tanks and show us what happen when the aliens are shot? Why did they decide right away to blow up the bridges? It lacked details and the viewers certainly need them. Excellent acting, suspenseful and very intense! Better than original What an incredible film!  A great addition to the Quiet Place franchise! Absolutely loved the character study and Lupita was just stunning I found myself shallow breathing so I wouldn't be heard by the aliens. So, yes I enjoyed it! The lead actress was amazing. Not near as good as the first two. Looking at how much time is left in the movie like five times tells me all I need to know. This was a nice little slice of life story from the Quiet Place universe. It didn't try to do to much and was a solid addition to the franchise. The movie was okay. I wouldn't watch it again. I have a home theater at home and did a movie night with family and friends and ALL of us were left disappointed. It was boring, sad, and no story really there. The acting was good but the movie overall was unfortunately a no from everyone who joined us at movie night. It wasn't as scary, but was entertaining and cool!
 Definitely Recommend!! Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn do a super job of portraying so many emotions with little dialogue, the bond of two survivors over their trauma. More of a thriller than an action-horror movie. emotional scary Rollercoaster found myself enjoying it more than I thought I would as I never seen any of the films before this. Got sold as the prequel and origin story to a good monster movie franchise. Instead got a character study about cancer and a mediocre one at that. Don't bother. To me it was an equal amount of jump scares and deep emotion, I thought it was fantastic!! The good:
1. The performances were truly fantastic for everyone. This was just an incredibly well made movie all round. The acting, vfx, the score, the cinematography, all of it. Truly fantastic.
2. The story was not what I expected but it was all the better for it. This showed the bond of people suriving and caring for each other, even in extreme circumstances. It kind of gives you hope.
3. I'm a dog guy but I've had a couple cats... this movie makes me want to get another cat

The Bad: 
1. The pacing was slow in some bits and I felt the movie drag. It's a bit jarring when you go from the action to slower shots and walks down an abandoned street... I get what they were going for, giving time to breathe after all the action, but somehow just missed the mark
2. Some logic decisions I struggled with within the story. That scene when people are in the street for instance. I just thought no sane person would join... 
3. This movie makes me want to get a cat

Overall: I love the 1st, really like the 2nd and this is a solid prequel and seems justified. Really really solid, I would put on par with the 2nd. Cannot wait to see what they do next"
Horror,new_life_2023,"New Life is a terrific directorial debut from John Rosman with outstanding performances and a narrative that grips you from the start and never lets go. While the first 15 minutes seem a little too deliberate, once the ball gets rolling and the facts literally spill, Rosman promises a finish you won’t forget any time soon. With slick, visual style, writer-director John Rosman skilfully keeps everything grounded, which makes the bonkers craziness and excellent makeup work that much more effective. Amid the dumper-truck of post-Covid lockdown-inspired films, very few take disease and pandemics themselves as their central focus. So John Rosman’s stripped-back but effective debut is a sobering flashback to those incubative early days. New Life entertains with fast-moving shooting action, creepy screaming creatures, ample guts, and moments of profound humanity.  While New Life holds few pleasures as it twists and convulses into new genres, it excels at glimpses of terror and jaded job execution.  An unsettling relevance lingers beneath the surface of this taut and tightly wound thriller that puts a fresh spin on familiar genre conventions. New Life is filled with potential, moving close but stopping on the edge of excellence. A well-acted, well-directed, well-written film to help you turn off the world for a few moments.  While the horror moments in the film are far more effective than the dramatic moments, New Life keeps viewers hooked and engaged throughout. Surprisingly compassionate and ultimately compelling, this ironically titled debut might under the skin of those who may be immune to the usual methods of pandemic panic.  “Rosman builds to a powerful resolution and ideal ending moment in ‘New Life,’ using gore and traditional methods to escalate the tension, and then pulls the rug away from the audience — a reminder of who’s in control, a tease of what’s to come.” Lovers of hard-core horror with elements of science fiction and allusions to body horror, rejoice. [Full review in Spanish] A deeply human piece wrapped in the skin of a thriller, New Life will stick with you for years to come. This interesting attempt to mix body-horror suspense with character drama doesn't entirely work, because the intended psychological depths are underdeveloped. But it's worth a gander, not least for former Berkeley Rep company member Tony Amendola. ‘New Life’ combines them with bursts of blood and fury, but the tenseness provides some emotional brevity to push it past a theme we’re familiar with. Rosman falls back on an all-too-familiar bag of tricks to conjure some would-be scares. The possibility of an anticlimax becomes something more akin to an inevitability.
 Though New Life's characters may not find the world they are desperately running towards, it is Rosman’s work that contains entire worlds of its own.   The film does some interesting things with [its concept], playing with the agony of lingering self-awareness amidst terrifying bodily transformations. The makeup is superb, and the over-the-top practical effects got at least one gasp out of me. Once the picture of what's really happening here becomes clear, it only highlights how gimmicky the structure is and how shallow the movie's goals are.","Stunning. One of those examples of a movie that seems so straightforward and simple but days later you find yourself untangling deeper layers to it. Never seen a film tackle illness as an idea and theme like New Life. I’m sorry but when was the last time you were moved to tears during a horror movie? Wow Decently acted but poorly written and directed.  A lot of the decisions of the main character and the people following her just didn’t make sense.  Seemed much longer than its 85 min runtime.  Would not recommend. If you like zombie movies I guess.  It presents as something more serious, or deep, but you'll quickly discover it's not. It is scary enough, so, one star. Some good PSA about ALS, not sure how it ties in with the overall plot though. Everybody says ""the less you know the better"" well if knowing it's a zombie movie will ruin it for you you're probably better off skipping it, like I wish I had. Pretty good. But as usual, these types of movies always have to have somebody who's the lead investigating the case always have something wrong with them. Cancer, ALS, alcoholism, etc. Can't anybody just be a healthy person investigating a case? I mean I get the poignant moment at the end for what she's going through, but why? Then of course as these types of movies go, don't ever inform the public of what's happening and just let the person who's carrying the disease that they're tracking just keep spreading it everywhere and cause worldwide deaths. And of course even after you capture her, don't ever tell her that she's carrying a disease and she's spreading it and killing people. Oh no, you can't possibly do that. We rather risk her spreading it to other people or killing a guard to escape and then maybe tell her later when she's dying. I mean come on. slow. not horror. terrible storyline Surprisingly good for an indie horror movie, New Life offers a new angle on the zombie genre, showing what is often told through flashbacks or monologues. The acting was decent as well, but the pacing was flawed. It was way too slow to ramp up suspense and got to the point of boring. Not surprised to see this film as polarizing. But I think if you open your mind and heart to this film…it will move you in a way that’s very rare for horror films. Breathtaking. A small but massive horror film. Film school level. Maybe junior year. I want my money and my 90 minutes back. It has a very student movie feel to it. Not well written; like why don't the people trying to track down patient zero just TELL HER what the problem is. The direction isn't any better.  All very amateurish. The director even thanks his parents in the end credits. resident evil rip off that confaltes covid-19, ebola, hiv, and zombies. flat plot with flat, stock characters filled with buzzword ""science"" that hides the ball so you can see if they end it differently than every other virus jump scare movie you've seen. worse than mall cops 2. Although the movie kind of felt like it was missing something, I very much enjoyed it. The story was engaging and it has been a while since I've seen a good disease/pandemic movie. 
The ending could have been better but it's a great watch. This has the look and feel of a movie that wants to be good but just isn’t there yet. The film industry is competitive. This is not a certified fresh movie, and should have been streaming free. This movie was so much better than it had any business being. The best advice would be to go into this one with little to no knowledge. Don't read any synopsis, watch a trailer, or read the reviews. Just sit down for under 90 minutes and let them tell this compelling story. Just a well-told, gripping tale. Enjoyed this a lot. Highly recommend! This was so close to being a great movie, and is one of those cases where less is more.  There should have been no expositions about pharma companies, no tech scenes of computer screens searching conversations and street cameras, no conference calls about ALS, and no gratuitous infected attack scenes to artificially ratchet suspense.  If these affectations had been left on the cutting room floor, this would not just have been a good movie; it would have been great.  I'm sure the writer/director is well aware of this, but had to pack those components in to get the movie made in the first place.  The climax still packs a punch - more so because of the sounds of the wind - as impersonal and amoral as a virus.  If the entire movie had stayed true to that theme, it would have been amazing.  Sparse.  Sharp. Harsh as a blade.  No explaining.  The audience would have caught up.  Still good - but felt like a missed opportunity. The movie ends in the middle part. After that is just gross makeup and free violence with no story to tell. There is no horror or suspense I this movie. This is a very bad movie. Let me start by saying I don't generally like horror films, at least not in the traditional format, and this film is not your general formatted horror. It blurs the lines of genres likebody horror, thriller, apocalyptic, drama and romance. It's so refreshing to see an original film. It's about the time when it left to the other end but it never had completed the start so when they finished it never came back to where it started and then it unfolded into something that never ended. I'm confused by the first 10 minutes. I thought it was intense based on the end going back to the beginning to the middle I think this movie is really gross, I give it a gross rating lower than the x rated version of Caligula!!!"
Horror,infested_2023,"It's a constantly surprising, shocking, and satisfying creature feature. generates trepidation by using the same real-life evolutionary ques that make the small eight-legged critters scary in the first place: surprise, speed, size. It also flirts with some bigger conceptual ideas to varying degrees of success. Packed with eight-legged creepy crawlies, the film sits between Arachnophobia and Kingdom of the Spiders. Infested guarantees to raise the hairs on the nape of your neck, make your skin crawl, and upset your stomach. The sort of movie that’s impressive as a technical exercise (...) but it’s the groundwork laid by a good script enacted by good performers that make it stick with you like a skittering stowaway unobtrusively depositing a clutch of eggs in your pocket. Infested is about how neglect and misunderstanding always end in tragedy: for children, naturally, but also for entire societies... The film works when it is focused on the creepy crawlies – the smaller the creepier – but loses its way down the stretch into an unfocused bout with social commentary about the power structure being worse than giant murderous spiders. The theme of residents versus cops may remind some viewers of the “Rec” Spanish film franchise, but instead of using the residents as obstacles and threats to sympathetic outsiders investigating the phenomenon, the residents are centered  Creepy, icky, and pretty effective.  The characters feel real and organic in Infested, and the performances are noteworthy.  Features some of the most skin-crawling, anxiety-inducing scenes in any recent horror movie, executed with impressive skill for a feature debut. Despite its third act, Vanicek’s film is still one of the best spider horror films ever. 
 This potent creature feature foregoes camp and B-movie playfulness in favor of making you squirm out of your chair. It's one of the most effective spider horror movies — one of the most effective creature features, period, for that matter — in decades. What makes Vanicek’s Infested so smart is that in amongst the creepy arachnid terror lies a broader, heavier theme concerning social problems in France stemming from the country’s violent colonial history. A genuinely merciless thriller, and absolutely the best creature feature in recent memory. Fair warning for the skittish and the arachnophobic. Infested wants to remind you why you were scared of spiders as a kid — and why you should still be terrified of them even as an adult. Infested is a well-made, tightly presented thriller that uses its grotty, rundown setting and its misfit characters who, despite their faults, we actually start to care about as they are forced together by something truly ghastly... There’s effective tension in Infested, solid work from the performers, a decently balanced story, and a pretty frenetic third act. Pretty good for the latest film about creepy crawlers. Of course, the main thing here is to play on the audience's innate fear of spiders, and this is a staggeringly effective freak-out. But the best thing I can say about Infested is that I squirmed in my seat as if I were sitting on a chair made out of upturned nails for the majority of the running time. In Infested, the spiders are nasty, ugly, big, and scary. The characters act the part too....they're terrified. You will definitely be checking any dark corners of your domicile after a fresh watch. Guaranteed. ","Good but wondered the entire film why they didn’t immediately call an exterminator. This movie has a lot of the same beats as Arachnophobia but presents a cast of characters with few, if any, redeeming qualities.

What should be a frightening dive into a group of people's attempt at survival against swarms of spiders turned into a group of people bickering about unrelated drama.

When the house is on fire, it's time to get out, not resolve all of your past trauma with everyone you've ever loved/hated. The ""drama"" only exists because none of the characters are able to convey a thought that isn't an insult or whine. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, which makes sense. If you write your characters with only flaws, of course they're going to be insufferable.

I'm not saying that Paris deserves to get destroyed by swarms of spiders, but that apartment building sure did. Bad movie bad actors they just scream all the time waiste of time Made me frightened on every sight of a spider for a month, great movie Very Underrated Movie A genuinely intriguing watch, at first. The acting was good before the situation becomes more terrifying for the main cast. There are a lot of great shots that actually made me jump and close my eyes. Which as a horror junkie who usually doesn't flinch at jump scares was impressive. However, as the movie progresses the nature of the spiders becomes more and more convoluted to the point it really hurt my sense of immersion for the whole situation. 


Spoilers** Specifically, it seems the movie starts out as trying to ground itself in a realistic setting, and overall context with its acting too. But the rate at which our spider friends spread and grow isn't just a bit unrealistic, but completely ridiculous. I think the movie would have benefited a lot from keeping to a bit of realism in how a situation like this *might* happen. Instead of the situation reaching a breaking point within 24 hours, maybe the situation could progress over a few weeks or months. Empieza bien pero... llega un momento que dices... para para... que se mueran los protas porque... hacen más daño ellos que las arañas pero salen impunes... 


(SPOILER: Si haces que mueran todos los polis por lo menos meteme polis corruptos o que sean malas personas, no te los cargues y lo pongas como algo no más importante que bajar a por pan ...) Had to take a middle ground on this one, if you are scared of spiders this is a good horror that will frighten you. If you are not scared of spiders then it's a general plot with not much to keep you engaged.

Some of the family found it terrifying and some found it boring so it's a 50% score overall. At first it's fine but then the situation becomes completely exaggerated. The worst horror movie I’ve ever seen. I do not understand how it can have a rating this high. If you are in the mood for creepy crawly thrills, this French Horror is a great watch. The real stars of this movie (the spiders), delivered a copious amounts of jump scares. Sébastien Vanićek manages to keep the suspense and pace going, with some cleverly written scenes. scariest movie ever 2024 Kaleb lives in a suburban apartment complex in Paris. Passionate about exotic animals, he adds a venous spider to his eccentric collection. Problems arise when the spider escapes and evolves into a deadly army threatening all residents. Despite offering some intense moments, ""Infested"" is not scary enough to crawl under the audience's skin (except for those who suffer from arachnophobia). Spiders everywhere, impressive atmosphere but also impressive stupidity of the protagonists(don't even get me started at that fight with the cops...) It was a ok movie but I felt like the ending could been better and the cops to me felt like generic bad cops. other than that the movie had some pretty cool camera angles and some good shots and the music was great even if at times it took the horror aspect away. Pretty good for a scare alright. The creepy crawlies were anxiety inducing for sure. As a social commentary, I notice a lot of people commenting on the fact that it's about the power dynamic between the police and lower class in France? Fair enough. Thay commentary is certainly on the nose in a few scenes.. I saw it a little bit differently however. When you remember where the spider came from at the start and what language and religion the shop keeper was who sold the spider, I'm inclined to think of the ""infestation"" into France as something different, but no less accurate- especially when one looks at the demographic change in Paris over thr past 30 years for example. But who's to say 🤷‍♂️ Gritty and effective creepy crawly horror. This film is a hidden Gem! If you didn’t like it you’re probably too young or sniffed too much glue as a kid (or old fashioned “permanent “ markers). If you didn’t get either of aforementioned references then yes, you are too young. I loved it!!! Not scary at all and very forgettable. I don't get why it has a good rating here. Well acted garbage. Don't waste your time"
